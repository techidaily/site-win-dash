## Option 1: Update your keyboard driver for Windows 7 manually

 You can first head to the hardware manufacturer’s website and search for the latest driver for your keyboard. **Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your keyboard, and your version of Windows.** Then download and install the driver manually.
