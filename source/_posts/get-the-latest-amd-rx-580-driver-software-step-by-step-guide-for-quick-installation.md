### **Option 2 – Update your driver from official websites**

 If you’d like to update your driver from its official website, you need to know the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of your notebook or other devices with a fingerprint sensor. Given that the process of finding, downloading and installing the driver varies from person to person, this post will simply outline the method in a brief way.

 For example, if you’re using a Lenovo laptop, you can visit the official site of Lenovo and locate its**Support** section (that is where they usually provide drivers or other software for customers to download). Down there you should select “Drivers & Download” or whatever so that you can enter the download page of drivers. Usually there will a search box for you to type in your device model or the driver name, etc. As long as you give the right name, the website will automatically display a list of drivers that are considered to match your request. Select one from them depending on your Windows version (such as Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit), download it and install it step by step. On completion, please reboot your PC to let the changes take effect.
