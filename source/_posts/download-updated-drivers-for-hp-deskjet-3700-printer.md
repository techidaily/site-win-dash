### Way 2: Update KODAK printer driver via Driver Easy automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **Driver Easy** .

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 That’s it.

Hope you own the correct drivers on your PC now.
