 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. If it doesn’t make sense to you, you may refer to **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and learn how to install the drivers manually.
