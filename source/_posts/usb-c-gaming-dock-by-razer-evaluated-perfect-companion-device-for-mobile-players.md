##  Design: Small, Slim, and With Portability In Mind

 USB-C docks can be useful for many reasons, whether you are missing important ports on your laptop or want more accessible ports for your desktop. But not every dock fits every need. The Razer USB-C Dock is made specifically for laptop gamers. It's slim and easy to slip into a laptop sleeve, and the USB-A cable to plug it in is short enough to keep it out of the way—though too short to effectively use with a desktop tower.

 You get 11 ports with this dock: four USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, an Ethernet port, one HDMI port, slots for SD and microSD cards, and a 3.5mm audio jack. It's everything a gamer would need to plug in their controllers, connect to an external monitor, and ensure a great wired connection.

 But, it is important to note that this is a USB-C dock made explicitly for gamers, and if you plan to mainly use it for productivity, you'll come away disappointed. When I need to be productive and get work done on a laptop, I don't need an Ethernet port or an audio jack—I'd need another HDMI port and maybe a Thunderbolt dock. The Razer USB-C Dock would still be serviceable in a pinch for productivity, but there are a lot better options on the market.

 That said, this little dock is a game-changer for laptop gamers.

##  An Ethernet Port Is a Big Deal

 One thing that helps Razer's USB-C dock stand out from the crowd is an Ethernet port. While not entirely unheard of with a dock, it isn't particularly common, either. As many USB-C docks are created with productivity in mind, an Ethernet port will take a back seat to other ports that are considered more important. Having a wired connection is low on the list of priorities for the average professional.

 But all gamers know that a wired internet connection is better for playing games online than a wireless one. However, most laptops don't have a direct Ethernet port, so it's nice that Razer allocated space for one here.

 Better still, the Ethernet port works as well as a port directly built into a tower or laptop. When testing speeds on my desktop, the internet speed on the dock was the same as it was when I plugged the cable directly into the tower. I had no issues with my connection, whether working or gaming—I could have completely forgotten the Ethernet cable was even plugged into a dock, given how seamlessly it worked.

 While this may seem like a given, I've had enough older docks and extension cords that would degrade the signal quality or data transferred, so seeing that's not the case here is promising.

##  Charge Your Laptop With Your Dock

 Another unique aspect of the Razer USB-C Dock is the ability to charge your laptop via a passthrough USB-C port. The port delivers up to 85W of power. For comparison, a MacBook Air M3 needs at least 65W for fast charging, and my gaming laptop (a 2021 Lenovo Legion laptop) accepts power delivery from 65W to 100W.

 However, it's important to remember that these power ratings are generally for when a laptop is off or in sleep mode. If you're using the laptop or playing a game that will drain the battery faster, it's unlikely that the Razer dock's Power Delivery will be able to keep up.

 That said, the power delivery port will certainly extend the time you can actively use the laptop before you need to shut it down, and given that many laptop chargers (especially gaming laptop chargers) are large and unwieldy, this is a great substitute if you're out and about.

 Normally, with power delivery passthrough on a dock, you have to decide if you want to forgo some other ports and features to save on the price, have a bulky dock that's harder to slip into a laptop bag, or just pay a lot to have it all. Razer's dock does lean more toward that third camp with its higher price point, but compared to other docks with similar features on the market, the company manages to balance cost with useful features well.

 If you're a laptop gamer, you need the [Razer USB-C Dock](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-11-Port-Charging-Station-Chromebook/dp/B0CPGZTX6C?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004322&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Frazer-usb-c-dock-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) in your arsenal. This small but effective accessory makes up for the lack of ports your gaming laptop likely has, and the pass-through charging is a great bonus. For those that game on desktop or use their laptops for productivity, this Razer dock is a harder sell, given the price point and some of the types of ports it's missing.

 However, Razer targeted a specific niche with this USB-C dock, and they succeeded in catering to the needs of that niche well, managing to stand out in a relatively saturated market. So, if the Razer USB-C Dock sounds like just what you need, don't hesitate to snap this one up.
