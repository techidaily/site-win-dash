![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lenovo-thinkpad-t420s.jpg)

 **Lenovo ThinkPad T420s** is a rather old model of computer. You will see the notification telling you that it is “**no longer available for purchase on lenovo.com** ” even if you want to purchase it now.  
  
 That being said, it is not easy for you to find solutions to its driver problems when they occur when you are a Windows 10 user. To save you countless time and energy, we will guide you through the whole process of getting the device drivers downloaded and updated with step-by-step and easy instructions, so, choose accordingly the right way for you!

[**Method Two: Update T420s device drivers manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Three: Update T420s device drivers automatically (RECOMMENDED)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/thinkpad-t420s-drivers-download-update-for-windows-10/#3)

 ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_583d25f77a789.jpg)

 3) If you see any device driver with certain mark next to it, such as a yellow exclamation mark, a question mark, etc., right click it and choose**Update Driver Software…** .We are updating **Base System Device** , yours could be different.
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_583d26d86670e.jpg)
  
 If you don’t see a device driver with the unusual mark, and you just want to update certain device driver, that’s okay, just right click the device driver that you want to update and choose**Update Driver Software…** .
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_583e933a476f5.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_583d275459f1b-600x437.jpg)

 5) As we mentioned above, this model of computer is rather old, so there is a big chance that you are not getting the latest version of the device drivers in this way, and you will be very likely to see the following notification:

 1) Go to the support website of Lenovo. Then in the middle part of the page, type the model type of your computer into the search box, or you can choose**Detect my product** option for the support website to detect your computer model.
