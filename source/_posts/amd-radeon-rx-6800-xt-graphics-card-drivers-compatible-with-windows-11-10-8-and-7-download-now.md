![amd rx-6900 xt driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/amd-rx-6900xt-driver.jpg)

 AMD RX 6900 XT, the newest gaming GPU of AMD’s Radeon 6000 series, has arrived. To enjoy the ultra-high frame rates and serious 4K gameplay as this flagship GPU deserves, you’ll need the latest AMD RX 6900 XT driver.

Here are two ways you can update the driver safely:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-amd-rx-6900-xt-driver-for-windows-7-8-10/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
