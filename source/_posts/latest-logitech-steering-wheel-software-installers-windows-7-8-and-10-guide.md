![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_9-59-38-2.jpg)

 If you’re using a Logitech G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel on your PC, make sure you have the correct driver installed for it to function as it should.

 The Logitech G29 software runs on your operating system and enables it to communicate with the racing wheel you’re using.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your Logitech G29 Racing Wheel:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/logitech-g29-driver-download-for-windows-10-8-7/#a2)**
* **[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
