##  Check the Key That Turns Off the Caps Lock

 Ensure that you—or anyone sharing your device—haven't unintentionally configured the keyboard settings to [disable the Caps Lock](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-adobe-premiere-pro-on-mac/) when the Shift key is pressed.

##  Ensure the Caps Lock Key Isn't Faulty

 If Caps Lock is configured to toggle off when you press the Caps Lock key, but it's not responding, the key may be faulty. To check this, go to a keyboard testing website such as [Keyboard Tester](https://www.keyboardtester.com/) and click "Launch the Tester." Once the testing window is open, press the Caps Lock key and observe whether it registers successfully.

 If the key registers and the testing window starts to type letters in lowercase, the key is not faulty. However, if the key doesn't register and fails to change the case, it indicates a defective key. It is possible there is debris inside the keyboard, causing keypresses to not register correctly. You can try [cleaning your keyboard](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/accelerate-operations-master-document-handling-through-automation-technology-in-the-finance-sector/) to see if that solves the issue. If that doesn't work, you can either have your keyboard (or laptop) inspected or [disable and remap the Caps Lock key](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/constructing-premium-canon-timelapse-movies-for-2024/).
