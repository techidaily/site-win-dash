## Effortless Camera Setup: How to Update Webcam Drivers for Enhanced Performance on Windows 11

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/webcam.png)

 If you’re having problems with your camera and tried[all these fixes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/camera-doesn-t-work-in-windows-10-32adb016-b29c-a928-0073-53d31da0dad5) that Microsoft suggested, the main cause is a corrupt, outdated, or incompatible webcam driver. You should update the webcam driver for Windows 10 to make sure your webcam always in tip-top condition.

## What are webcam drivers?

 Windows and your camera don’t speak the same language. Drivers are like interpreters between Windows and your devices. When you’re using your webcam, the driver takes the Windows command and translates it into something your camera can understand.

 Similarly, if your camera needs to send some sort of response back to Windows, the driver translates the response into something Windows can understand.

 Therefore, your camera or other devices may not work properly (they can’t talk anymore) if the driver is missing, outdated, or corrupted.

## How to update webcam driver

 If you have no idea how to update a webcam driver, we’ll walk you through the whole process of downloading and installing a new driver.

You can update your drivers either manually or automatically:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/webcam-driver-for-windows-10-download/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1 – Manually

 If you have time and computer skills, you can download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website, and install them manually.

**Note:** You can update the webcam driver using the Windows inbuilt tool — Device Manager, but Device Manager often won’t give you the latest driver anyway ([learn why](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).

 To get the correct webcam driver from the manufacturer’s website, you need first to find out the driver provider and your driver version. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** and click **OK** .
