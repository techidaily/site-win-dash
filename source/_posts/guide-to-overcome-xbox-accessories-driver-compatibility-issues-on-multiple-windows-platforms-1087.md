## What is RNDIS?

 **RNDIS is short for “Remote Network Driver Interface Specification”** . It is a Microsoft proprietary protocol, which is often used on top of USB. As a protocol, RNDIS provides a virtual Ethernet link to most versions of the Windows, Linux,**Android** and FreeBSD operating systems.

 If a yellow warning icon appears next to it, it indicates that Windows has identified a problem with it. In most cases, this issue can be fixed after you reinstall or update its driver.
