## Try these fixes

**Note** : Updating your wireless network adapter requires the Internet connection. If you don’t have the WiFi connection, try Ethernet connection or **[Offline Scan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  provided by Driver Easy which enables you to update network adapter drivers with no Internet connection.

There are two ways you can update your Intel wireless AC 9560 driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/intel-wireless-ac-9560-driver-download-update/#f2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Intel keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the Intel download center, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 1) Open **[Intel Download Center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  in your browser.

 2) Type**AC 9560** in the search bar and select**Intel Wireless-AC 9560** to continue.

 3) Choose your operating system in the drop-down menu next to**Filter by** . In my case it’s Windows 10 64 bit.

 5) Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
