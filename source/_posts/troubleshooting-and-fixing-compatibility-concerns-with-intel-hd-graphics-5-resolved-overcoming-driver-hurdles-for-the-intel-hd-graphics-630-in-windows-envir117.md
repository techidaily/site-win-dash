If you want to ensure the stability of your AMD Radeon RX 590 graphics card, you should keep its driver up to date.

## To update your AMD Radeon RX 590 graphics card driver

There are two ways you can do this:

**Download and install your RX 590 driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the **[AMD website](https://www.amd.com/)**  , and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your graphics card, and your version of Windows.

or

**Download and install your RX 590 driver automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your RX 590 driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to your_RX 590 graphics card_ to download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it. Or click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all the drivers. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.
