## EVEO Bluetooth Device Driver - Download Now to Enable Seamless Connectivity

Bought an EVEO Bluetooth USB adapter for PC but it’s not working? If the unplugging and replugging hasn’t solved the problem, you may need to download its driver for help.

 A user has proved after installing the driver, the EVEO Bluetooth adapter worked just fine.

 EVEO used to provide Driver download support, however, the link is not working anymore, it will redirect you to a marketing platform. The decision that EVEO changes the download link might relate to Microsoft have discontinued Windows 7 support.
