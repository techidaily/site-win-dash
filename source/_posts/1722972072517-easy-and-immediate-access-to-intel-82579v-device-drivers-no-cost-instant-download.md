![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-77.png)

 Are you looking to download and install the latest driver for**Intel 82579V Network Adapter** ? If the answer is “yes,” then you’ve come to the right place. Here we’ll show you how to update this driver step by step.

There’re mainly two options for you:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/free-download-intel-82579v-drivers-quick-easy/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

---

## Option 1 – Automatically update the driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually,**you can do it automatically with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update drivers both online and offline. According to your actual situation, jump ahead to the section you’re interested in:

* **[My network connection is not stable but still works at times](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[My network connection doesn’t work at all](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
