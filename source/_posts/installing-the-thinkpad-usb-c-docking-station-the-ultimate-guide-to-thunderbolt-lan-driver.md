There’re two ways to update your HP Thunderbolt Dock G2 drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/hp-thunderbolt-dock-g2-drivers-120w-230w/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1: Update the driver manually

 Updating your HP Thunderbolt Dock G2 driver manually (either 120W or 230W) requires you to download and install multiple drivers, including the firmware, the Realtek Ethernet controller driver, and the USB audio driver. Here’s how:

1. Go to the[Software and drivers section](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-thunderbolt-dock/20075223/model/20075224?ssfFlag=true&sku=) for HP Thunderbolt Dock 120W G2\. (For HP Thunderbolt Dock G2 with Combo Cable, check[this page](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-thunderbolt-dock-g2-with-combo-cable/21816261) .)
2. Expand**Docks-Firmware and Driver** , and select each driver you need from the result list. Then**choose your Windows version** (for targeted drivers), and click**Download selected files** .

3. Once downloaded, run these executable files and follow the on-screen instructions to install.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take full effect.
