## Why should I update the Nahimic audio drivers?

**[Nahimic](https://www.nahimic.com/gamers/)**  is a piece of audio software that boosts audio and voice performance in games, thereby enhancing player immersion. Although the program itself is powerful enough, you can still expect it to do a better job by updating your sound card drivers.

 Besides, you should keep your audio drivers up-to-date in order to secure the stability of your audio devices. An outdated or corrupt driver can lead to the malfunctions of Nahimic, so if you want to get the most out of it, updating your audio driver seems necessary.

### Option 1 – Download & install the drivers from manufacturers

 Usually you can get the sound card drivers from the manufacturer of your motherboard. To do this, simply visit its official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. If you’re using the Realtek HD Audio Driver, you can also download the driver from **[Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/en/downloads)**  .

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. On completion, restart your PC for the changes to be fully implemented.

### Option 3 – Update the driver automatically (recommended)

 Some people may find it hard to locate the correct driver online. And even if you successfully find it, it’s still time-consuming and error-prone to install the driver.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
