 If you have a Logitech speaker and want to have an aurally immersive experience when playing a computer game, you should update your Logitech speaker driver.

There are two ways to update your Logitech speak driver:

1. [**Update your Logitech speaker driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your Logitech speaker driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/logitech-speaker-drivers-free-download-for-windows/#o2)

## Option 1: Update your Logitech speaker driver manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your Logitech speaker driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step:

 Logitech keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Logitech Support](https://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/category/speakers-and-sound)**  page, check out the section for speakers, and click the**MORE** button under your Logitech speaker. Then, check out the section for driver downloads, and click the**DOWNLOAD NOW** button next to the latest software version to download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your Logitech speaker and your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can try Option 2, below.

## Option 2: Update your Logitech speaker driver automatically (Recommended)
