 Your printer won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. Printer issues, such as blank page printing, error code messages, etc., commonly occur when the driver is corrupted or outdated.

 So it’s essential that you have the latest correct driver for your printer at all times. There are two ways you can get the driver easily and safely:

* **[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/canon-mf8200c-driver-download-for-windows-7-8-10/#b)**

### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Canon keeps updating the MF8200C driver. To get the latest driver, you need to go to the **[Canon support website](https://www.canon-europe.com/support/)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Canon MF8200C driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
