## Why do you need to update the T300 drivers?

 Driver functions as a translator between your device and operating system. Your operating system and your device don’t actually speak the same language. When your operating system gives a command to your device, your device can not understand it. Therefore, your operating system and your device need a translator. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices but drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

This is why most of the problems can be solved by updating drivers.

## 2 Methods to update the T300 drivers

Here are two methods to update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Method 1: Update the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
