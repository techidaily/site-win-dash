 It's important to note that Group Policy Editor is _not_ available in Windows 10 or Windows 11 Home. It only ships with Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise editions.

##  Open the Group Policy Editor from the Start Menu

 Perhaps the easiest way to open the Group Policy Editor is by using search in the Start menu. First, click the Start button, and when it pops up, type **gpedit** and hit Enter when you see "Edit Group Policy" in the list of results.

 If you don't see "Edit group policy" in the Start menu results, you either entered a typo or you're running a Home edition of Windows 10 or Windows 11 which do not include the Group Policy Editor.

##  Open the Group Policy Editor from the "Run" Window

 You can also quickly launch the Group Policy Editor with a Run command. Press Windows+R on your keyboard to open the Run window, type **gpedit.msc**, and then hit Enter or click "OK."

##  Open the Group Policy Editor from Control Panel

 And finally, we have one of the slowest ways to open the Group Policy Editor: from Control Panel. To do so, [launch Control Panel](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-facetime-call-recording-securing-your-conversations/), and then click the search box in the upper-right corner of the window. Type **group policy**, and then click the "Edit Group Policy" link just below the "Administrative Tools" heading.

![In Control Panel, search for group policy then click 'Edit Group Policy.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gpedit-from-control-panel.png)
