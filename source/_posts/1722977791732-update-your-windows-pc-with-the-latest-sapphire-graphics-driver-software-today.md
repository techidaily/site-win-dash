5. Windows will scan for updates of the graphics driver for you, and install it if there’s any available.

Restart your PC to let the new driver take effect.

### 2: Manual download from the manufacturer’s website

 Manufacturers release updates for their graphics cards quite often. If you’re looking to get the latest driver for your Sapphire graphics card, you can find it on[AMD Support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support) . Search for your product, and make sure to only download the driver that’s**compatible with your Windows Version** . Once you’ve downloaded the driver, you’ll need to install it manually.

### 3: Automatic update (Recommended!)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your Sapphire graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system, find the correct driver for your exact video card and your Windows version, then download and install it correctly:
