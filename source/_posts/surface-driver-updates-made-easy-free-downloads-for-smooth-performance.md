![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf7cf002737a.jpg)

 Itâ€™s always important to**keep all the drivers in your Surface Book up-to-date** so as to keep it in tip top condition and nip all sorts of common computer issues like BOSD in the bud.

 In this post, weâ€™re going to show you 2 easy ways to get the latest drivers for your **Surface Book.**

## To update Surface Book Drivers

**[Option 1 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/surface-book-drivers-download-update-easily/#O1)**  â€“  This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

**OR**

[**Option 2 â€“ Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) â€“  Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### **Option 1: Update your Surface Book drivers automatically (Recommended)**

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**Driver Easy**   will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. You can upgrade to **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **ALL**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bf7cabf4d114.jpg)  
 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.
4. **Restart**   your computer for the changes to take effect.
