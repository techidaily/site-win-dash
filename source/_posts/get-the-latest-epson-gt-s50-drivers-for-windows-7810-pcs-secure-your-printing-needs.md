### Option 1: Automatically (Recommended!)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your keyboard drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact keyboard, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and 30-day money-back guarantee).

 01 Download and install[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 02 Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 03 Click the**Update** button next to a flagged keyboard driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Manual installation, however, is required. Please refer to Option 2 below to see how to install the driver.
