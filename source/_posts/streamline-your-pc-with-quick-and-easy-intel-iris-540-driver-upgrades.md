 Looking to update your Intel Iris Graphics 540 driver but not sure where to get the latest download? If yes, then you’ve come to the right place. In this post, you’ll have two ways to download and install the driver efficiently.

## Why should I update the Intel Iris Graphics 540 driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is a printer, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, if you ever encounter any problems relating to your graphics card (such as game crashing), try to update the corresponding driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble. Or if you want to make the most of your GPU, keeping the drivers up to date is also important.

## How to update the Intel Iris Graphics 540 driver

To update the Intel Iris Graphics 540 driver, you have two options:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-intel-iris-graphics-540-driver-quickly-easily/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1 – Automatically update the driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Intel Iris Graphics 540 driver manually,**you can do it automatically with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
