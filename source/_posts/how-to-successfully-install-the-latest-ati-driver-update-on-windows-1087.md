### Option 1: Update Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)

**Driver Easy**   will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

### Option 2: Update Bluetooth driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update our Bluetooth driver since our Windows system automatically detects what Bluetooth driver we’re using and helps us find one available. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .
