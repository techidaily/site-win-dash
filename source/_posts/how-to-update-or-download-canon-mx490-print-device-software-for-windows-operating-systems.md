 If you’re looking for the**Logitech Driving Force Pro driver** , you’ve come to the right place.

There are 2 ways you can get the driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/logitech-driving-force-pro-drivers-download/#a2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Logitech keeps updating the Logitech Driving Force Pro driver. To get the latest driver, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Go to the **[Logitech official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , click**SUPPORT > Downloads** .

**5)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically install the Logitech Driving Force Pro driver

**3)** Click the **Update**  button next to the Logitech Driving Force Pro driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
