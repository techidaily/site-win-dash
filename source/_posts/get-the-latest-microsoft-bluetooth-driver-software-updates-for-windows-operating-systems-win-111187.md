### Method 1: Update your Atheros drivers manually

 If youâ€™re looking to update your**Atheros** **network adpater** /**Wi-Fi** adapter driver but**WITHOUT** proper Internet, you might first have to download the driver on a computer with workable network and then transfer the file to the target computer to install. But if you do have Internet access, do all the steps on the same(target) computer.

 The whole manual**Atheros** driver download & update process  needs time, patience and certain levels of computer skills. If youâ€™re not comfortable playing  with device drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to **[Method 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do it automatically.

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** **![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

4) Depending on whether Windows provides you a driver update:

* If **yes** , then follow the on-screen instructions to update the driver and skip the rest of the steps. Then restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
* If **no** , and instead you got the message **The best drivers for your device already installed** , then you might have to continue with the following steps to get the latest driver for your**Atheros** product. Since the message isnâ€™t always true and Windows can be slow in keeping up with driver releases .

 5) Under contractual obligations, Qualcomm Atheros doesnâ€™t offer drivers for us users. Instead, we might have to  go to the original equipment manufacturerâ€™s website, and click the**Support** (or**Drivers** /**Downloads** ) section.

 6) Enter your**product model** and search for driver downloads.

 7) Click**the first result** to make sure you download the latest version.  Be sure to choose**ONLY** drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions.

 8) Download the file and install the driver.

 9) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
