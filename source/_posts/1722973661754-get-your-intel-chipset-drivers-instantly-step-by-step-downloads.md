## To update your Intel CPU drivers

Generally there are three ways you can update your Intel CPU drivers:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**[Option 3 – Update drivers via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This method is simple and commonly used. However, you should note that Windows may not be able to detect and download the latest (and even necessary) drivers for you.
