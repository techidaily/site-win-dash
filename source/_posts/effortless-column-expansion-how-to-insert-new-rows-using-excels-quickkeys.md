 If you are a keyboard ninja, then you hate having to move your hands from the keyboard for any reason unless there is no other option. Today's SuperUser Q&A post provides multiple ways to help a frustrated reader keep his hands on the keyboard while using Microsoft Excel.

 Today’s Question & Answer session comes to us courtesy of SuperUser—a subdivision of Stack Exchange, a community-driven grouping of Q&A web sites.

##  The Question

 SuperUser reader jstricker wants to know how to insert new rows in Excel using a keyboard instead of a mouse:

> Right-clicking on a row and selecting insert is fairly time consuming. I would rather not have to take my hands off the keyboard. How can I insert a new row above my current row using only the keyboard? I am primarily interested in inserting a single row at a time, but would also be interested in answers that address inserting multiple rows at a time.

 Is there an easy way to insert new rows in Excel using a keyboard?

##  The Answer

 SuperUser contributors jstricker, ATG, KRyan, BillOer, and assylias have the answer for us. First up, jstricker:

> There are two options that I am aware of and both (unfortunately) require two steps.
> 
> **Option 1** 
> 
> 1. With a single cell selected, hit **Shift** \+ **Space** to select the row.
> 2. Hit **Control** \+ **Shift** \+ **+** (Plus Sign) to insert a row above the current row.
> 
> **Option 2** 
> 
> 1. With a single cell selected, hit **Control** \+ **Shift** \+ **+** (Plus Sign) to insert a row.
> 2. Hit **Enter** to accept the default of Shift Cells Down.
> 
> If inserting many rows at once, I think the first option is the best since you can repeat the second step without having to re-select the row.

 Followed by the answer from ATG:

> The following keyboard shortcut will insert one row above the active cell's row:
> 
> Press **Alt** \+ **I** (Insert), then press **R** (Row).
> 
> On personal computers, use the **Keyboard Right-Click Key** to emulate a right-click on the current selection.
> 
> Additional note from ATG: Substituting **C** for **R** will insert a new column.

 Then the answer from KRyan:

> It is worth noting that this is a sequence, not necessarily keys to be pressed simultaneously (see answer from ATG above). You can type **Alt**, then **I**, then **R** and get the same effect.

 Followed by the answer from BillOer:

> You can also select multiple rows and then right-click to insert rows, or you can insert one row and then use **Ctrl** \+ **Y** as many times as you need to insert rows. If you format your spreadsheet as a table, you do not even need to worry about copying your formulas.

 And our final answer from assylias:

> On Windows I use:
> 
> 1. **Shift** \+ **Space** to select the current row.
> 2. **Keyboard Right-Click Key** \+ **I** to insert a row.
> 
> (\*) The Keyboard Right-Click Key looks like this:
