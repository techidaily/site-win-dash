##  The Other Stuff

_Reuters_ reports that [MediaTek is working on ARM-based processors](https://www.reuters.com/technology/mediatek-designs-arm-based-chip-microsofts-ai-laptops-say-sources-2024-06-11/) for Windows PCs. That could make MediaTek another competitor for chips in ARM laptops, as the [first Windows laptops](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/enhancing-stories-through-animations-with-movie-maker/) with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips are about to arrive. AMD and NVIDIA are also rumored to be working on PC ARM chips.

 Meanwhile, Microsoft announced an [all-digital Xbox Series X](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options/), with no disc drive and a lower $450 price tag. There will also be a new limited edition 2TB regular Xbox Series X and a 1TB Series S.
