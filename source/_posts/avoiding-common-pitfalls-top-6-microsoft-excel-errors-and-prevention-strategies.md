 Many people find Microsoft Excel a complex program, but that's often because they find themselves fixing mistakes they've made when constructing their spreadsheet. In this article, I'll explore common Excel errors, how to avoid them, and how that will make your life a lot simpler.

 The following tips specifically relate to the Excel desktop app, though they're also actionable on the web-based version of the program. Where the methods are slightly different, I've added a note to explain this.

##  Merging Cells

 This one might come as a surprise, as many believe that merging cells is the best way to cover a whole row when the same data applies to each cell.

![Data in Excel with one row merged and centered.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/merge-and-center.png) 

###  The Issue

 However, merging cells causes issues when you try to perform actions with your data. This is mainly because many of Excel's functions rely on you having a consistent setup of rows and columns, and merging cells causes your sheet to break this consistency.

 First, if you try to sort your data, you'll receive an error message.

![An Excel spreadsheet with an error message reading 'To do this, all the merged cells need to be the same size.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/merge-error.png) 

 Likewise, you'll encounter an issue if you try to paste data from an unmerged row to a merged row.

![An Excel spreadsheet with an error message reading 'You can't do that to a merged cell.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/merge-error-2.png) 

###  The Solution

 First, click "Merge and Center" to unmerge the cells. Then, select the cells again, and click the icon in the bottom-right corner of the Alignment group in the Home tab.

![An Excel sheet with a row selected and the Alignment icon highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/excel-alignment.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Open the Horizontal drop-down menu in the Text Alignment section of the dialog box, click "[Center Across Selection](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-motorola-moto-g73-5g-by-drfone-android/)," and click "OK."

![The Excel Format Cells dialog box with the Alignment tab opened. The Horizonal option is changed to 'Center Across Selection,' and the OK button is highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/excel-alignment-center-across-selection.png) 

 You will now see the text appear as it did when you used the Merge And Center option, but the cells' structures and integrity have been retained.

![An unformatted Excel table with one of the rows containing the word 'Absent' in the center of the row.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/center-across-selection-excel.png) 

 "Center Across Selection" only works across rows, and not down columns.

##  Creating Tables Manually

 Admittedly, before I became a power user of Excel, I didn't realize the issues that creating and formatting tables manually would cause.

###  The Issue

 I used to format my data and copy formulas to new rows manually, but I always encountered issues if I wanted to add new rows or use my data to create a chart. For example, in the screenshot below, I have manually colored alternate rows—but when I add a new row, this affects my formatting, and I'd have to start all over again.

![An Excel table with alternate rows manually colored. An additional row has been added to the center of the table, so the rows are no longer alternately colored.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/manually-formatted-table.png) 

 Similarly, if I add a filter to the columns, when I reorder the data, this will also mess up my formatting.

![An Excel table with its manual formatting altered due to column H having been sorted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/excel-manual-formatting-filter.png) 

###  The Solution

 There's a really easy way to deal with these issues. First, select all the data in your original, unformatted table, including your header columns and rows. Then, in the Home tab,[click the Format As Table drop-down arrow](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-convert-your-best-videography-into-melodic-mp3s-insta/), and choose a design that works for you.

 To do the same in Excel for the web, select your data and click Insert > Table.

![An Excel worksheet with data selected and the Format As Table option highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/format-as-table-excel.png) 

 In the Create Table dialog box, check the "My Table Has Headers" checkbox if you have a header row at the top of your table, and click "OK."

![Excel's Create Table dialog box with the My Table Has Headers checkbox checked and the OK button highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/format-as-table-with-headers.png) 

 Give your table a name in the Table Design tab, so that you can refer to the table in formulas or jump to the table quickly using [the name box](https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-vogue-videos-compiling-free-youtube-channel-frames/).

![An Excel table with the Table Name changed to Team_totals in the Table Design tab on the ribbon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/table-name.png) 

 In the same tab, you can also change the Table Style and Table Style Options (such as including a filter button or banded rows), as well as a bunch of other actions to perfect your data presentation.

 Now, if I were to add a row or column in the center of the table, the formatting would automatically update. I can also use the handle in the bottom-right corner of the table to add more rows to the bottom or columns to the right. Finally, Excel would automatically apply formulas to any new rows I add.

 Overall, formatting your data as a table makes Excel aware that it's not just a string of data, but instead should behave as a table, making everything a lot easier down the line.

##  Having Blank Rows and Columns

 Many people (and, surprisingly, online Excel tutorials) leave row 1 and column A of their Excel sheets blank, probably because they think it makes their spreadsheets look better. This is probably due to the fact that in Microsoft Word, you can physically see the page borders, but you cannot in Excel until you preview your print layout.

![An Excel spreadsheet with row 1 and column A left blank. There are also some other rows containing no data.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/excel-gaps-in-rows.png)

###  The Issue

 Aside from the fact that this is unnecessary, as Excel will automatically add page borders when you print your data, leaving rows and columns blank can cause other problems. For example, blank rows can disrupt your [sorting and filtering](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-frame-flair-choosing-the-best-video-cameras-for-deliberate-moves/), and they can also lead to formula issues and error messages when [using AutoFill](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-best-hdmi-21-gaming-monitors-ps5-compatible/).

![An unformatted table in Excel containing blank rows, which cause the DIV0 error message to appear when performing an AutoFill operation.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/error-messages-in-blank-rows.png) 

###  The Solution

 If you only have one or two blank rows or columns, you can right-click the row number or column letter and click "Delete."

![A circle shows where to right-click to bring up a row's options in Excel, and the 'Delete' option is selected.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/delete-row.png) 

 However, if you have lots of blank rows, you can use the COUNTA function to rectify this. Scroll across to the right until you reach the end of your data, and in cell 1, type

=COUNTA(

 and select all the data to the left of that cell. Then, press Enter.

![An Excel sheet with the COUNTA formula typed into the highest cell to the right of the data.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/counta-top-row.png) 

 Next, drag the AutoFill handle to the bottom of your data.

![An Excel spreadsheet with the AutoFill handle highlighted and an arrow indicating the downwards direction of the AutoFill.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/counta-autofill.png) 

 Now, select the whole column containing your COUNTA formulas, and in the Editing group on the Home tab, click the "Sort And Filter" drop-down arrow and click "Sort Smallest To Largest."

![An Excel sheet with column J selected, and the 'Sort Smallest To Largest' option in the Sort and Filter menu highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sort-and-filter-whole-column.png) 

 In the Sort Warning dialog box, choose "Expand The Selection" and click "Sort."

![An Excel sheet showing the Sort Warning dialog box, and the 'Expand The Selection' radio box is checked.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/expand-sort-selection.png) 

 You will then see all your blank rows move to the top, which you can select and delete.

![An Excel sheet with the top four rows selected for deletion.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/excel-delete-several-rows.png) 

 Finally, delete your COUNTA column.

##  Typing Sequences Manually

 There are many circumstances in Excel that require you to present data sequentially, such as ascending numbers or date intervals.

###  The Issue

 However, typing sequential data can be time-consuming and cause problems if you mistype a value or miss one out.

![An Excel sheet with numbers typed across row 1. The number 4 has been accidentally omitted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/manually-typed-sequential-data.png) 

###  The Solution

[Excel's AutoFill can recognize patterns in your data and fill in the rest for you](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-best-hdmi-21-gaming-monitors-ps5-compatible/). Start by typing the first two values in your data. Then, select these values and use the AutoFill handle to complete the data.

![An Excel sheet with the numbers 1 and 2 typed into cells A1 and B1 respectively, and the AutoFill handle is highlighted with an arrow pointing in the direction to click and drag the AutoFill handle.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/autofill-numbers.png) 

 This will also work if your numbers are alongside other text in the cells (for example, **Day 1**, **Day 2**, and so on), and other sequential values such as dates.

 Excel doesn't recognize letters in the alphabet as a pattern, so use numbers if you want Excel to AutoFill the data for you.

##  Using the Wrong Reference Type

 Referencing other cells in formulas is a great way to link your data together and update calculations automatically based on changing cell values. In this example, I have referenced cells B2 and F1 when calculating the total value in cell C2.

![An Excel sheet with a formula in C2 which references cells B2 and F1, as seen in the formula bar at the top.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/referencing.png) 

###  The Issue

 However, many people encounter problems when using AutoFill, as they might not understand the different types of references in Excel.

 When I use AutoFill to calculate the totals for the remaining items, it doesn't seem to have added the 20% tax to the values.

![An Excel sheet showing calculations that have not worked.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/autofill-not-worked.png) 

###  The Solution

[There are three types of references in Excel](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-techniques-for-enhanced-minecraft-zooms/), and it's crucial you understand what they are and what they do if you want to copy calculations to other cells.

**Relative references** assess the relative positions between cells. In the example above, the initial calculation was made between cells C2 (where I typed my formula), B2 (one to the left of C2), and F1 (three to the right and one up from C2). When I copy this formula to cell C3, Excel will reference the cells in the same relative positions to where I am typing.

![An incorrect cell reference in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/incorrect-cell-reference.png) 

 So, I would need to use an **absolute reference** to tell Excel to continually reference cell F1 when I AutoFill downwards. To do this, I would add dollar symbols before each part of the cell reference, or press F4 after typing or clicking the cell I want to reference.

![An Excel formula containing $F$1 as an absolute reference.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/absolute-reference.png)

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1521325/16446" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Then, when I AutoFill the remaining totals, Excel will continue to reference F1 to make the calculation.

![An Excel worksheet with a formula in the formula bar containing an absolute reference to cell F1.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/absolute-reference-2.png) 

 If I wanted to keep my row reference or column reference the same but let Excel adjust the other according to my formula's location, I would use a **mixed** **reference** by typing the dollar symbol before the relevant part of my reference.

##  Not Locking Cells or Using Data Validation

 Excel is great for creating a spreadsheet and then sharing it with others to add their data.

###  The Issue

 However, if you share your sheet with someone who either isn't very accustomed to Excel or has a habit of changing things you don't want them to change, this could lead to your hard work being quickly undone.

###  The Solution

 Excel lets you control what other people can enter into a spreadsheet through [data validation](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/mastering-iphone-saving-and-utilizing-gifs-effectively/) and [locked cells](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-savor-playtime-the-essential-guide-to-high-quality-offline-ios-games-for-2024/).

 Data validation dictates what type of data can be input into a cell. Click the relevant cell or cells and, in the Data tab, go to the Data Tools group and click "Data Validation" in the Data Validation drop-down option.

![A cell in Excel is selected and the Data Validation option is highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/data-validation.png) 

 In the Validation Criteria section of the dialog box, click the "Allow" drop-down arrow and define the data type and range for the cell or cells. You can also have a message appear when someone clicks on those cells using the Input Message tab, and create a pop-up message if someone tries to input the wrong type of data using the Error Alert tab. When you're done, click "OK."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you want to lock the cells you don't want people to change at all, you can protect the worksheet. By default, when you protect the worksheet, all cells are locked, so you need to first choose which cells other people _can_ click or edit.

 To do this, select and right-click those cells, and click "Format Cells."

![An Excel sheet with three cells selected and right-clicked, and the Format Cells option highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/format-cells.png) 

 Then, in the Protection tab, uncheck "Locked," and click "OK."

![The Format Cells dialog box in Excel with the Protection tab open, 'Locked' unchecked, and the OK button highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unlock-cells.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 When you're ready to send your sheet, click "Protect Sheet" in the Review tab, **uncheck** "Select Locked Cells", and **check** "Select Unlocked Cells". You can also enter a password if you wish. Then, click "OK."

![Excel's Protect Sheet dialog box with Select Locked Cells unchecked, Select Unlocked Cells checked, and the OK button highlighted.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/protect-sheet-settings.png) 

 You will now see that only the cells you selected are clickable and editable.

 To reverse this action, click "Unprotect Sheet." If you password-protected your sheet earlier, you'll need to type the password again to complete this action.

 To do the same in Excel for the web, click "Protection" in the Review tab, and use the sidebar to choose which cells to unlock.

 As with any software, especially the Microsoft 365 suite of programs, practice makes perfect. Over time, you'll develop your own understanding of the best ways to use Microsoft Excel [at work](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/ace-your-content-game-on-instagram-with-these-6-powerful-apps-for-2024/) and [at home](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-smart-strategies-for-securely-saving-movie-moments-across-gadgets/), but avoiding the mistakes discussed in this article will certainly speed up that process.
