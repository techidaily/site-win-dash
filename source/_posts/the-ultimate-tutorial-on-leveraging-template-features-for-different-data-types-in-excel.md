Microsoft offers several data types templates to help you track all sorts of things.

 These templates help you use the cities data type to plan a relocation, the [stocks data type](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-guide-cost-effective-pc-screen-recording-apps/) to track your investments, and the food data type to log meals for your diet.

##  Use a Data Types Template in Microsoft Excel

 Once you download a template and open it in Microsoft Excel, it's ready for use right from the start. However, the "Welcome" tab gives you a helpful, short, and sweet summary of how to use that particular template. Each template is a bit different from the others, but they all begin with you entering a keyword or phrase.

![View the Welcome tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Welcome-ExcelDataTypesTemplate.png) 

 For this how-to, we're going to use the Movie List template. With this template, you can track your favorite movies, view details like cast and box office totals, and include a rating and review of your own.

 Start by entering a keyword or phrase in the appropriate cell that applies to the data type. For the Movie List, you'll enter a film title.

![Enter a key word or phrase](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TypeHere-ExcelDataTypesTemplate.png) 

 Once you enter your item, the template takes over and fills in the remaining details.

![Details added automatically](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DataDetailsAdded-ExcelDataTypesTemplate.png) 

 If for some reason the data for your word or phrase cannot be found, you'll see a question mark next to it. Click the icon to open the Data Selector sidebar, and then search for and select the correct item.

![Click the question mark and select the right item](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SelectCorrect-ExcelDataTypesTemplate.png)

 Some templates have several tabs for you to work with, and the data types that you add populate those, too. For example, our Movie List template has a tab for the actual Movie List as well as tabs for Dashboard and Cast.

 The Dashboard shows the films that you add to the list as movie poster images and includes ratings as well as movies by decade and genre.

![Dashboard tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dashboard-ExcelDataTypesTemplate.png) 

 The Cast tab has a drop-down box at the top that populates with the movies that you add to your list. Select a film from this box and you'll see the movie's cast, director(s), and producer(s).

![Cast tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cast-ExcelDataTypesTemplate.png) 

 Other tabs in the template can also contain more information. Using our Movie List example, if we visit the Cast tab, we can get more details on a cast member by clicking the contact icon next to their name.

![Click a data type icon for more details](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MoreDetails-ExcelDataTypesTemplate.png) 

 If you'd like to see even more details for your data type that aren't in the spreadsheet, it's easy to do. Just click the data type icon next to it. Just like with the cast member icon above, this will open the Data Card. You can drag to resize it or simply scroll through for more information.

 After grabbing one of these templates, be sure to check out each tab and icon for more details. When you finish, remember to save the file like any other Microsoft Excel workbook. Then, pop it open and add more data to it anytime!
