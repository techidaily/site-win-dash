 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.

 2) Click **Scan Now** .  It will quickly detect all drivers problems of your computer. Your Sound Blaster Z driver is no exception.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged Sound Blaster Z driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **[FREE version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ).
Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.
