### Method 1: Update**AMD RX 580**  driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update drivers because Windows can help us find the right driver and save us a lot time in finding one. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

 2) Locate and double-click on   **Display adapters** (aka.   **graphics card** ,   **video card** ) to expand it.

 3) Right-click on **Radeon RX 580 Series**  and click **Update driver** .

 4) Click **Search automatically for updated driver software** .

 5) Your Windows will try its best to find the latest **Radeon RX 580 Series**  driver available for your computer. Then wait a bit and see if you’re provided a driver update:

* If yes, follow the on-screen instructions, skip step 6 and restart your computer to finish the update process.
* If no, proceed with step 6.

6) You see the following result.

 It means Windows can’t find you an up-to-date **Radeon RX 580 Series**  driver. You might need to check other methods  to get it since Windows can be slow in keeping up with manufacturers’ drivers.
