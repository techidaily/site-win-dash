If you have a Samsung 960 EVO M.2 SSD, you should install the**Samsung 960 EVO M.2 driver** in your Windows computer. And this post will show you how to download and install Samsung 960 EVO M.2 driver in Windows 10/8/7.

There are two ways you can update your Samsung 960 EVO drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/samsung-960-evo-m-2-driver-download-and-install-in-windows/#M2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Samsung keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the Samsung support, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

Here’s what you need to do:

1. Go to **[Samsung Support center](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fsemiconductor%2Fminisite%2Fssd%2Fproduct%2Fconsumer%2F960evo%2F)**  .
2. Click**Download** **Files** .

4. Run the downloaded file, and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There is something else you can do.
