## Get Your Creative Recon3D Gaming Audio Card Driver Here

If you’re going to keep your Creative Sound Blaster Recon3Di sound device in good condition, or if you want to make the most of it, you should make sure its driver on your computer is up to date.

## To update your Sound Blaster Recon3Di driver

 There are two ways you can use to install the Sound Blaster Recon3Di driver on your computer:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some patience to install the driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/creative-sound-blaster-recon3di-driver-download/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 To get the Sound Blaster Recon3Di driver, you need to go to the **[Creative](https://creative.com)**  or your**motherboard manufacturer** website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows 10 (32 or 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
