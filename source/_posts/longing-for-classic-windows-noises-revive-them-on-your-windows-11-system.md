##  How to Get Sound Packs of Old Windows Sounds

 The first thing you need to do is download a sound pack containing the sounds from an old Windows version. Also, ensure that every sound it contains is in WAV file format.

 An example of where to find sound packs is the Sound Schemes Gallery page on the [WinCustomize website](https://www.wincustomize.com/explore/sound%5Fschemes/). You can find sounds for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and more. Select the one you want and click “Download” to save it to your computer.

 The sound pack's file extension will be SOUNDPACK, which Windows will not recognize. You need to [change it to a ZIP file](https://android-location.techidaily.com/9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-xiaomi-mix-fold-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) just so you can extract the sounds.

 If you can't see the file extension, ensure you've [enabled the option to see file extensions](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-free-youtube-revenue-predictor-tools/).

 Next, right-click the sound pack and select Show More Options > Rename in the context menu.

Close 

 Then, delete **soundpack** from the file name and replace it with **zip**. Click “Yes” in the prompt to confirm that you want to change the file extension

Close 

 The sound pack will now be a ZIP folder. Next, [extract the zip file](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-art-of-content-optimization-for-maximum-subscriber-acquisition/) to view the contents of the sound pack. You should see several WAV files, so go through them and confirm it has all the sounds you want by listening to them.

##  Change System Sounds in Settings

 Once the sound pack is downloaded and extracted, it's time to change the system sounds. To do this, go to Settings > System > Sound and click "More Sound Settings" in the Advanced Section.

![The "More Sound Settings" option in the Windows 11 Settings app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/manage-sound-settings-windows.png) 

 Next, select the "Sound" tab, and click the "Save As" button. This will allow you to create a new sound scheme so you don't mess up the Windows default (you can revert to it whenever you want). Now, give the new scheme a name, and click the "OK" to save it.

Close 

 Next, you must change the sounds for various system events in the Program Events section. For example, to change the Windows startup sound, select the "Windows Logon" event. Then, click "Browse" in the Sounds section.

 Navigate to where you extracted the sound pack, highlight the logon sound, and click "Open" to select it. For example, in the Windows XP sound pack we downloaded, it was the "Windows XP Startup.wav" file.

![Selecting the startup sound for Windows XP in a sound pack.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/windows-xp-startup-sound.png) 

 You can click "Test" on the left side of the "Browse" button to verify you have selected the right sound. Then, go ahead and change the rest of the sounds. Afterward, click "OK" to close the dialogue box and save the changes.

##  How to Enable Changing the Login Sound

 If you find that the "Windows Logon" and "Windows Logoff" events are missing in the Program Events section, you can unhide them in the Registry Editor.

 One important thing to do before you proceed is to [create a system restore point](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-multiplying-joy-sharing-a-pile-of-photos-and-videos-with-instagram/). This will back up a copy of the Windows Registry. That way, if you make a mistake, you can [use the restore point](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/in-2024-proven-methods-to-infuse-engaging-dialogue-in-videos/) to undo it.

 To do this, press Win+R to open the Registry Editor and paste the following file path into the address bar:

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AppEvents\EventLabels\WindowsLogon

![The file path of the "WindowsLogon" key in the Registry Editor.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/regedit-windowslogon-key.png) 

 Then, double-click the "ExcludeFromCPL" value to edit it. Set "Value Data" to **0** and then click "OK" to save the changes. Afterward, you should be able to see the "Windows Logon" event when changing system sounds.

Close 

 Do the same for the "ExcludeFromCPL" value at the following file path to unhide the "Windows Logoff" event:

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AppEvents\EventLabels\WindowsLogoff

 So, that's how you bring back those nostalgic Windows sounds you miss. You can create as many sound schemes as you need for different Windows versions.

 You can take the retro overhaul a step further, beyond sounds. For example, if you're creating a Windows 2000 sound scheme, you can also [make Windows 11 look like Windows 2000](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-video-backgrounds-teammeeting-blurring-guide/).
