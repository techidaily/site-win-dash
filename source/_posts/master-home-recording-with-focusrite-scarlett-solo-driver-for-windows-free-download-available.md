### 2: Manual download from the manufacturer’s website

 Manufacturers release updates for their graphics cards quite often. If you’re looking to get the latest driver for your Sapphire graphics card, you can find it on[AMD Support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support) . Search for your product, and make sure to only download the driver that’s**compatible with your Windows Version** . Once you’ve downloaded the driver, you’ll need to install it manually.

### 3: Automatic update (Recommended!)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your Sapphire graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system, find the correct driver for your exact video card and your Windows version, then download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.
