## Get the Latest TP-Link UB400 Bluetooth Adapter Drivers Here

Device drivers allow your devices to work properly on your computer. And the latest driver keeps your**TP-Link Bluetooth adapter** in great condition while making the most out of the hardware.

 There are two ways you can install or update the TP-Link Bluetooth adapter driver:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/tp-link-bluetooth-adapter-driver-download-update/#option2)**  – You don’t need to be tech-savvy to keep your drivers up to date. All you need are a few clicks and a computer with Internet.

**OR**

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This requires some computer knowledge. You need to visit the official website and search for your model. Then download the wizard that needs additional configuration during installation.
