## Latest Logitech K400+ Driver for Enhanced Performance – Download Now

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-23_11-07-44-1.jpg)

 The Logitech K400 Plus driver runs on your computer, and enables it to communicate with the wireless keyboard you use. Your device won’t fully function if the driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer.

 So, if you’re using a Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 Plus and it’s not working properly now, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

 There are two ways you can get the latest correct Logitech K400 Plus driver:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically update the Logitech K400 driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-logitech-k400-plus-driver-issues/#a)**
* **[Option 2 – Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
