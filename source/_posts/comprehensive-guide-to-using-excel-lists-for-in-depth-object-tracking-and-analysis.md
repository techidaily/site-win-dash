 Microsoft Excel is known for being an excellent tool for tracking things like a [budget](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/top-9-benefits-of-switching-to-chatgpt-plus-enhance-your-ai-experience/), inventory, or sales and revenue. But there are so many [templates available](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/top-10-honor-x50-android-sim-unlock-apk-by-drfone-android/) you might not realize exist that can help you track just about anything.

 You might use a list app to track chores or to keep track of the movies you want to watch. If you already use Excel, why not take advantage of it for tracking these types of things too? It just might save you some time.

##  How to Access Templates Inside of Excel

 You can access the below templates in the Excel desktop app or via the [Microsoft template website](https://templates.office.com/en-us/templates-for-excel). On your desktop, open Excel and go to the Home section. Select "More Templates" and then use the Search box or browse the categories.

![Template area in Excel on the desktop](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SearchBrowseTemplates-ExcelListTemplates.png) 

 In our examples below, we'll include web links to the templates so that you can view them online. Some templates are available for use in Excel for the web or as a download to use in the desktop application.

##  Weekly Chore Schedule Template

 Does everyone in your home pitch in with chores? If so, making sure everybody knows what they're responsible for is key to [getting it all done](https://www.reviewgeek.com/76683/the-11-best-apps-to-help-you-get-stuff-done-this-spring/). Try this [Weekly Chore Schedule template](https://templates.office.com/en-us/weekly-chore-schedule-tm04022394) that you can print and then pop up on the fridge or family bulletin board.

 This weekly chore list gives you spots for all the tasks along the left. Then, it's easy to add the person who's responsible for each task on any given day. Each family member can then add a checkmark when they complete the chore.
