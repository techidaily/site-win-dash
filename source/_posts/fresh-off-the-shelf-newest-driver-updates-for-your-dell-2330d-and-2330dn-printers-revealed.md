![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_5785fb1427b5c.png) When you find yourself in one of the following situations with your**Dell 2330d**or**2330dn**printer, you might need to consider installing or updating the printer driver:

* You are having problem installing your printer
* Your printer was not automatically installed when you connected it to your computer and turned it on
* You are getting a printer error message
This post describes two methods as to how to download and install the latest printer driver. Hope you find it helpful. **Method One: Dell Support**Before you start, you need to know the**operating system**of your computer.
