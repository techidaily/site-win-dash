 In this post, we will be showing you three different ways to get you Creative Sound Blaster drivers for your Windows 10 operating system.
  
[**Option One: Reinstall Creative Sound Blast driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[**Option Three: Update driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/creative-sound-blaster-drivers-download-update-for-windows-10/#3)

 **Option One: Reinstall Creative Sound Blast driver**

 4) When the uninstall finishes, restart your computer.
  
 5) If your computer doesn’t prompt to help you install the new driver when you restart it, you need to do it by yourself.
  
 Still, go back to**Device Manager** . This time, click the icon for **Scan for hardware changes** . Windows will help you detect the change and then install the new driver for you.

**Note** : There is no guarantee that Windows will find you the latest version of driver for your Creative SB device, it is just the easiest way to get a new driver and you should always see it as your first go-to option when thinking about updating drivers.
  
 **Option Two: Download and update driver manually**
  
 Note: You need to know exactly the model of your Creative Sound Blaster device to get the correct driver manually, i.e., by yourself.
  
 1) First, let’s go to the support website of Creative Sound Blaster. Then select your product from the list of choices. We’ll go with Sound Blaster X7\.
