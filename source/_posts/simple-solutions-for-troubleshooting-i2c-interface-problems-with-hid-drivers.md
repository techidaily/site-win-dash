### Method 2: Update network adapter driver manually

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise our PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

**Important** : If you can’t access the Internet, you might have to download the driver on an network-equipped computer first and then transfer the file to the target computer to install.

1. On the keyboard of the target computer, press  **the Windows logo key**  and   **R** at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and click  **OK**  .
