## How to update Actis 5 drivers

 Actually, you don’t have to install the specific driver to make SteelSeries Arctis 5 work or be recognized successfully. It comes with a plug-and-play feature.

 All you need to have is the generic USB audio driver and the onboard sound driver. Here’s how to do it:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/steelseries-arctis-5-drivers/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Manually update the sound driver

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.  
![uninstall graphics driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/device-manager.jpg)
2. Expand the**Sound, video and game controllers** . Then right-click the related devices, and select**Update driver** .
3. Click**Search automatically for drivers** .
4. Windows will start searching for the latest drivers and install them for you.

**Note:** Windows Device Manager doesn’t always detect outdated drivers. Nor does it always give you the latest available version if you update a driver. ([**Learn why…**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) )

 If Windows Device Manager fails to find a new driver for you, you need to source the driver directly from the device manufacturer or use a tool like ours, called **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , to do it automatically.

### Option 2: Automatically update all your device drivers

 One of the most common causes of sound issues is an outdated or faulty sound driver. Your SteelSeries Artis 5 is no exception.

 If you find the manual updating process tedious and time-consuming, you can do it update all your drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It always gives you the latest available driver.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Make sure you’ve set it up correctly

 Follow[**SteelSeries Actis 5 setup guide**](https://support.steelseries.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000022031-Setup-Arctis-5) to make sure you’ve done it right.

### Have the latest version of SteelSeries Engine installed

 In-app updates are supported so you will be prompted to update directly through the Engine. But if this doesn’t do the trick, you can uninstall the SteelSeries Engine, and download[**the latest SteelSeries Engine**](https://steelseries.com/engine) .

### Disable audio enhancements

1. In the bottom right corner, right-click the Volume icon, and select**Sounds** .
2. Under the**Playback** tab, right-click your headphone, and select**Properties** .
3. Switch to the**Enhancements** tab, check the**Disable all enhancements** option, and click**OK** to apply.

### Select different formats

 If you’re still unable to get anything, try selecting a different input/output format in the**Properties** \>**Advanced** window (use the headset steps above).
