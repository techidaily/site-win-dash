 **Way 1: Download the Intel bluetooth driver manually from your computer manufacturer**

 If you prefer to manually download the bluetooth driver, I’ll recommend you to download the driver from the computer manufacturer.  
  
 After Intel releases the latest version of the driver, some computer manufacturers will get the driver. Then they might have customized the driver to make it work best with their machine. So downloading the driver from the computer manufacturer will ensure the best performance of the driver.  
  
 To download the correct version bluetooth driver, you need to know these two things: your PC mother, the specific version of Windows.

 If you’re using a built computer or your computer manufacturer doesn’t provide Intel driver on their website, move on and use**Way 2** or**Way 3.**
  
**Way 2: Download the Intel bluetooth driver manually from Intel**

 You can download the generic Intel driver from Intel. Just to go to the[Driver Download Center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)  and download the correct driver for your Windows version.

 To download the correct version Intel bluetooth driver from Intel, you need to know what specific Windows version your computer is running.
