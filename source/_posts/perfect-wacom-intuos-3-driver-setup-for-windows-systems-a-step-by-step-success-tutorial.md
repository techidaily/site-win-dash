3. [**Update your mouse driver for Windows 7 via Device Manager**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Option 1: Update your mouse driver for Windows 7 manually

 You can first head to the hardware manufacturer’s website and search for the latest driver for your mouse. **Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your mouse, and your version of Windows.** Then download and install the driver manually.

## Option 2: Update your mouse driver for Windows 7 automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your mouse driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
