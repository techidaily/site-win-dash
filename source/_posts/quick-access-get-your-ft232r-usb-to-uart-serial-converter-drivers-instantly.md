## About the USB to VGA adapter driver

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/insignia-1.jpg)

 As the translator for your device and operating system, a device driver plays a significant role in making a device work properly. Your Insignia USB to VGA adapters, too, needs a specific driver to establish a connection.

 Normally, when you plug the adapter into your computer, the Windows system will automatically install the driver accordingly. However, sometimes the operating system fails to do so, and you’ll need to do it by yourself.

## How to update a driver

 The normal process of updating a driver manually is downloading the driver file from the manufacturer’s website, and then you can unzip the file and install the driver by yourself.

 However, you can use a trusted driver updater to help you install all the latest drivers automatically. This is the easiest way to update a driver. So we’ll include these two main methods below:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/insignia-usb-to-vga-adapter-driver-download-install/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
