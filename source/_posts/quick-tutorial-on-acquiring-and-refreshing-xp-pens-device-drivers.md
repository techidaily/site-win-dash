### Method 1: Update**AMD RX 580**  driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update drivers because Windows can help us find the right driver and save us a lot time in finding one. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

* If yes, follow the on-screen instructions, skip step 6 and restart your computer to finish the update process.
