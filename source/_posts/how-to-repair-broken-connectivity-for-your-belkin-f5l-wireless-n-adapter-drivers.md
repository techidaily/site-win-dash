## How to update the NETGEAR Wi-Fi adapter driver

 There are mainly two ways to update your NETGEAR wireless adapter driver, and you can choose the one you prefer.

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/netgear-wireless-adapter-driver-download-update/#Option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download and install it step by step.
