## How to Properly Download and Set Up Arduino Nano Board's Driver on a Windows Machine - Solved

If you’re using Arduino products to create your own work but failed to connect with your Windows computer, then you’ve come to the right place. It’s maybe caused by driver issues. This post is going to tell you how to fix it.

## Why you need the driver?

 As we know, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform let users design and create their own work. But when you need to connect it with a Windows computer, you’ll need a correct and appropriate driver.

 It is because drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why most of the problems can be solved by installing/updating drivers.

## How to download Arduino Nano driver?

There are two ways you can update your Arduino Nano drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-download-and-install-arduino-nano-driver-in-windows-solved/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
