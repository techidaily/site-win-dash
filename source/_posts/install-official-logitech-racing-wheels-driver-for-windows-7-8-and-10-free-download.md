## Why I need the Logitech T630 driver?

 The Logitech T630 driver runs on your operating system and enables it to communicate with the mouse you use. Your mouse won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. Also, mouse issues may occur when your driver is corrupted or missing. So, we always recommend you keep your Logitech T630 driver updated for security and stability.
