## Connect and Share: Seamlessly Include Your Android Device in Windows 11'S File Explorer

Microsoft is testing wireless Android smartphone integration in the Windows 11 File Explorer. This feature, which is currently limited to Insider Channels, should feel incredibly intuitive to anyone who's ever used a USB drive or SMB networking.

 There are already several ways to wirelessly transfer files between your Windows PC and Android smartphone. You can use the [Windows Phone Link](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-zoom-savvy-key-techniques-for-clear-and-confident-remote-conversations/) app, [KDE Connect](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/annualement-abbyy-integre-deux-personnalites-prestigieuses-a-son-organe-dirigeant/), or even an FTP client.

 Still, Android File Explorer integration is an incredible addition to the Windows operating system. Your Android smartphone will prominently appear in File Explorer's sidebar, just like a USB drive or local server. You can manage the smartphone's files from your PC or simply transfer files between the two devicesâ€”it's super easy.

 The requirements for this File Explorer integration are pretty straightforward. You need a Windows 11 PC with wireless capabilities (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), plus a smartphone running Android 11 or later. If you've set up Windows Phone Link, you should have no trouble adding your Android phone to File Explorer.

 Windows Insiders who want to test the new feature must enable it manually. First, check that you're running the BETA version of Link to Windows on your Android phone. From there, open Windows 11's Settings and go to "Bluetooth & devices." Go to "Mobile devices" and select "Manage devices." After telling your PC that it's allowed to access your Android phone, you'll need to toggle an option labeled "Access in File Explorer."

 Note that the Android File Explorer integration may not be rolled out to all Windows Insiders at this time. If you don't see the "Access in File Explorer" toggle, try again in a few days, as the rollout is somewhat slow.

 Microsoft will eventually bring this feature to all Windows 11 users. That said, we're still at the beginning of the testing period, and Android File Explorer integration currently suffers from [known issues](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/07/25/ability-to-access-your-android-phone-in-file-explorer-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/) that must be overcome before a stable release.
