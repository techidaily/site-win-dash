![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-06_11-27-37.jpg)

 The Logitech K350 driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with the keyboard you use. Your keyboard won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. So, When your keyboard isn’t working properly, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

There are two ways you can get the latest Logitech K350 driver:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically update the Logitech K350 driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-logitech-k350-driver/#a)**
* **[Option 2 – Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
