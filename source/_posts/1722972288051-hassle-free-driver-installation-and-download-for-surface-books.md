### **Option 2: Update your Surface Book drivers manually**

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PCâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

1. Go to **[Microsoft Surface Book Products Help](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/hub/4295272/surface-book-products-help)**  .
2. Scroll down to the Help list, then click**Install and update** \>**Download drivers and firmware for Surface** .
