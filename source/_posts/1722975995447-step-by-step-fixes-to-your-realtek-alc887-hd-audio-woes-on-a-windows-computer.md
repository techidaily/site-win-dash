If you want to download and install the**Realtek ALC887 driver** on your Windows computer, you’ve come to the right place! This post shows you how to fix the driver issue by installing the Realtek ALC8878 driver.

## Try these methods

There are two ways you can update your Realtek ALC887 driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Usually Realtek keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the Realtek website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
