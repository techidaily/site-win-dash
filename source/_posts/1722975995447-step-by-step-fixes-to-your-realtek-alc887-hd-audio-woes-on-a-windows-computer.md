### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Usually Realtek keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the Realtek website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 So you can head to the[Realtek website](https://www.realtek.com/) , search the driver for Realtek ALC887\. If you couldn’t find the result for the driver you need, you can contact Realtek support for further assistance.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
