## How to update your ASUS Z370-E drivers

 First of all, you should know that thereâ€™s no particular driver for a motherboard, but there are drivers for motherboard devices. For more details of what motherboard is and how to update motherboard drivers, you may take a look at **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Some of the most common motherboard drivers include chipset drivers, network card drivers, audio drivers, video drivers and so on. When you try to update these drivers manually for your ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-E gaming motherboard, you should be well clear about their specifications first.

Here we recommend you two ways to update the drivers.

**[Option 1 â€“ Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  

 OR  

**[Option 2 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-asus-z370-e-drivers-quick-easy/#option2) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ This is the quickest and easiest option.
