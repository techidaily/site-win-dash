##  Option 1: Download and install your driver manually

 To get the correct driver for your ATI Radeon HD 4200 graphics card, you should go to the **[AMD official website](https://www.amd.com/)**  and search “HD 4200” for your graphics driver download page, where AMD releases drivers and software for this graphics card. You need to download the correct and latest driver.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

 When the download process has completed, open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.
