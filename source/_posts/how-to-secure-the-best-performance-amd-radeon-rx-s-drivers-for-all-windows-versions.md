Here are two ways you can update the driver safely:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-amd-rx-6900-xt-driver-for-windows-7-8-10/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
