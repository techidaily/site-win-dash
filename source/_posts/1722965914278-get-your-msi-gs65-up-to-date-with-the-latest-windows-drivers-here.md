Looking for the **latest correct Prolific PL2303 driver for your Windows computer** ? You’ve got in the right place.

 In this post, you’ll learn two safe and quick methods to download and update your PL2303 driver. Read on and follow the easy guide.

## Pick the way you prefer

**[Option 1 – Manually –](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Prolific keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to[the official Prolific website](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/) , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update your PL2303 driver
