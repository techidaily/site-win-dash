## Windows 11 Copilot Assistant Discontinued - What You Need to Know About Its Departure

Microsoft is still trying to figure out the best way to implement Copilot AI in its software. Sure, it's present in most Microsoft software already, but as with all rollouts, there are some things that stick and some things that don't. Now, Microsoft's latest canary WIndows 11 update is making some changes to Copilot, including the removal of a very recently-added shortcut that might have actually turned out to be completely unnecessary.

 Microsoft has released Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26227 to the Canary Channel, introducing several significant changes and improvements. Notably, Microsoft is making another change to the Copilot experience on Windows, which has been transformed into a standalone app. This decoupling improves usability while also making it easier for Microsoft to update it without updating the whole operating system. As a result of this decoupling, Windows 11 is also removing the Win+C shortcut that previously fired up Copilot. It's not clear if it's an unintended consequence of this new decoupling or if it's an intentional change, but if it's the former, Microsoft apparently doesn't think the shortcut is worth implementing again.

 The update also includes support for Emoji 15.1, adding a range of new emojis and updating existing ones with new variations. In terms of settings, a new "Linked devices" page has been added under Settings > Accounts, enabling users to manage their connected PCs and Xbox consoles. This feature is available for Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 for users signed in with their Microsoft account.

 The update also addresses various known issues, including animation stutters, startup app problems, and location permission pop-up errors. Additionally, fixes have been implemented for issues related to Alt + Tab, Widgets, and explorer.exe crashes impacting live captions and voice access. You should definitely read through the original post for a more in-depth changelog. However, some known issues persist, including reports of Insiders being stuck on older builds. Microsoft is actively investigating this issue, and as a workaround, affected users can perform a clean install using the latest ISO and re-enroll in the Canary or Dev Channels.

 As usual, we should remind you that we're talking about [canary-grade builds](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-choosing-streaming-giants-vimeo-youtube-or-dailymotion/) here. The term "canary" in the context of release channels indicates the most bleeding-edge, and less tested, pre-release distribution channel, and you shouldn't use these builds as a daily driver at all.
