### Method 1: Update my Microsoft audio driver manually

**A WORD OF WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise our PCâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If youâ€™re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to[**Method 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 As it turns out, Microsoft doesnâ€™t provide drivers(except for those built-in generic ones that come in with Windows, which are always subpar). So in order to_manually_ get the right audio update for our computer, you might have to meet at least one of the following requirements:

* Your computer is a branded PC instead of an assembled PC;
* You know exactly what brand and flavor of audio hardware your computer has.

Alright then, letâ€™s get started:

 1) Go to**your branded PCâ€™s official website** or**your audio cardâ€™s manufacturerâ€™s website** (if you know exactly what brand and flavor of audio driver your computer is using).

 2) Check out the**Support** section for**driver downloads** .

 3) Find out and click the right download link for**your variant of Windows operating system** . Usually a few download options will be listed but you might want to click**the first** result for the latest driver version.

 4) Check the downloaded file:

* If itâ€™s an executable(whose name ends in**.exe** ), then go with steps 5) and 6).
* If itâ€™s zip file(whose name ends in**.zip** ), you might have to unzip it first, then go with 7).

5) Double-click on the file to install.

6) Restart your computer for changes to take effect.

7) After the un-zip, see if thereâ€™s an executable(whose name ends in**.exe** )

 If yes, double-click on the .exe file to install. Then restart your computer for changes to take effect.

 If no, then check out **[this link](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for steps to install your audio driver manually.
