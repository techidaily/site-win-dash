We’ll show you how to do just that.

##  Run as Admin from Windows Search or Start Menu

 If you search for and open your app using Windows Search (or Start Menu search) on your Windows 11 or 10 PC, you can run your app as an admin by searching for your app, [right-clicking](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-recording-fun-6-techniques-to-document-minecraft-for-2024/) it, and selecting "Run as Administrator." Alternatively, while the app is highlighted in the search results, click "Run as Administrator" on the right pane.

 If you're on Windows 11 and you launch your app from the "Pinned" apps section in the Start Menu, right-click your app and select "Run as Administrator." If you're on Windows 10, right-click your pinned app and choose More > Run as Administrator.

##  Open an App as Admin From Run Dialog Box

 Windows’ Run dialog box lets you launch apps on your PC. It’s possible to [open those apps with admin rights from this box](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-youtubes-most-captivating-storytellers-in-23/).

 To do that, open the Run dialog box by pressing Windows+R. In the box, type your app’s executable name.

 You can’t enter any app name in Run to launch it. You _must_ use the app’s executable name allowed to be used in Run. For example, use "cmd" to launch Command Prompt. You’ll use "winword" to open Microsoft Word, and so on.

!['winword' typed in Run.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-run-app-as-admin-from-run.jpg) 

 After typing the app name, press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. This launches an elevated instance of the app. Make sure to select "Yes" in the User Account Control prompt.

##  How to Make an App Always Launch With Admin Rights

 If you always launch a specific app as an admin, make Windows automatically do that for you. This way, you don’t have to right-click the app and select an option to make the app run in admin mode every single time.

 To do that, find your app’s shortcut on your desktop. Right-click the shortcut and select "Properties."

 In the Properties window, access the "Shortcut" tab and choose "Advanced."

##  How to Check if an App Is Running With Admin Privileges

 Wondering [whether an app is running with administrator rights or not](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-cutting-edge-techniques-for-capturing-ps4-games-in-obs/)? Windows’ Task Manager helps you find that information.

[Open Task Manager](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfect-palette-playbook-mastering-the-art-of-grading/) by right-clicking the Start Menu icon and choosing "Task Manager." In the utility, access the "Details" tab.

 For your app on the list, check the Elevated column’s status. If it says "Yes," your app is running as an admin. If it says "No," your app isn’t running with admin rights.

![The 'Details' tab and the 'Elevated' column highlighted in Task Manager.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-elevated-apps-task-manager.jpg) 

 If you don’t see the "Elevated" column, right-click an existing column and choose "Select Columns." On the open window, enable the "Elevated" option and choose "OK." You now have the Elevated column in the Details tab of Task Manager.
