## How to download the Gigabyte audio driver?

There are two ways you can update your Gigabyte audio drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-gigabyte-audio-driver/#op2) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

**1)** Find your Gigabyte motherboard model name.

 You might be confused: you’re looking for an audio driver, not the motherboard. It’s because all motherboards on the market come with embedded sound cards or onboard audio.  
 Therefore, if you want to download your Gigabyte audio driver, you must find its motherboard information.

**2)** Go to the[Gigabyte official website](https://www.gigabyte.com/us) and look for the Gigabyte motherboard model you have.

**3)** Click**Support** , and select your operating system to find the correct driver.
