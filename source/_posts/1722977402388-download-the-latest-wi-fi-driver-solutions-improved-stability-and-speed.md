## Fast Track to Improved Wi-Fi Performance with Driver Downloads

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-251.png)

 Are you seeking to download the corresponding drivers with your**wireless network adapter** ? If so, then you’ve come to the right place. As we all know, drivers are essential to your devices but the process of downloading and installing drivers can be quite fiddly sometimes. Don’t worry, here we’ll show you how to update your network adapter drivers step by step.

## How to download and install your wireless network adapter drivers

 Generally there are two ways you can update your wireless network adapter drivers:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1 – Automatically update your wireless network adapter driver

 For some people, it’s really time-consuming and error-prone to find the exact driver online, download it and install it step by step. If you want to save your time and effort, we highly recommend updating your drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a reliable driver updater tool.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-10_14-52-48-1.png)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or if you just want to update your wireless network adapter driver for now, simply click the**Update** button next to it.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-254.png)

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 We have a large number of wireless network adapter drivers that are both signed and tested by Microsoft, so there’s no need to worry whether or not you can find the correct driver with Driver Easy, or to worry about its security and compatibility.

 If you have any problems when using Driver Easy to update your drivers, please feel free to drop us an email at**<support@drivereasy.com>** . We are always here if we can help.

### Option 2 – Update your wireless network adapter driver manually

 If you feel like updating the wireless network adapter driver manually, here’s the simple and useful guide for you.

#### Update your driver via official websites

 Manufacturers of wireless network adapters such as Qualcomm keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to visit their official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Update your driver via Device Manager

 One of the most commonly used methods to update your driver is downloading and installing it via Device Manager. However, you should note that sometimes Windows may **fail to detect the latest (and even necessary) driver for your device** . In this case, you’ll have to search for the correct driver online or simply turn to **[Option 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. Press the**Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-255.png)
2. Here comes the window of**Device Manager** . Double-click on the **Network adapters** node to expand its drop-down list. Then right-click on your wireless network adapter and select**Update driver** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-257.png)
