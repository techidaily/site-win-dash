## 3 Options To Update AMD RX580 Drivers In Windows

 Here’re 3 options for you to update your AMD RX580 driver; just choose the way you prefer:

1. **[Update AMD RX 580 driver via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update AMD RX 580 driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update AMD RX 580 driver automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Update**AMD RX 580**  driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update drivers because Windows can help us find the right driver and save us a lot time in finding one. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

 2) Locate and double-click on   **Display adapters** (aka.   **graphics card** ,   **video card** ) to expand it.

 5) Your Windows will try its best to find the latest **Radeon RX 580 Series**  driver available for your computer. Then wait a bit and see if you’re provided a driver update:

* If yes, follow the on-screen instructions, skip step 6 and restart your computer to finish the update process.
* If no, proceed with step 6.

6) You see the following result.

 It means Windows can’t find you an up-to-date **Radeon RX 580 Series**  driver. You might need to check other methods  to get it since Windows can be slow in keeping up with manufacturers’ drivers.

### Method 2: Update**AMD RX 580**  driver manually

 If method 1 fails you, you can always get the latest version all by yourself. But it’ll need time, patience and certain computer knowledge. If you’re not comfortable playing  with device drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, you can jump to **[Method 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
