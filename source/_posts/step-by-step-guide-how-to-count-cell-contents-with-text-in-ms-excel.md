 Do you want to [count the number of cells](https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-the-error-of-unfortunately-the-processcomandroidphone-has-stopped-on-vivo-v29-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) that contain any or specific text while ignoring all other cells? If so, Microsoft Excel has a dedicated function to help you do that. We'll show you how to use it.

 In Excel, you can [use the COUNTIF function](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-clearing-out-windows-10-memory-dump-data/) to count either cells containing any text or cells containing specific text. Use the method below that works for your specific situation.

##  Count Cells With Any Text in Excel

 To count the number of cells that contain any text, but ignore any numbers, blank cells, and [errors](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-12-pro-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/), use the method here.

 First, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. In the spreadsheet, select the cell in which you want to display the result.

![Select a cell in an Excel spreadsheet.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-select-cell-3.png) 

 In the selected cell, type the following `COUNTIF` function and press Enter. Make sure to replace `D2` and `D6` in this function with the range where your cells to be counted are.

=COUNTIF(D2:D6,"*")

 Here, the \* (asterisk) argument tells the function to only count cells containing text.

![Enter the COUNTIF function to count all text cells.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-countif-count-text-cells.png) 

 You can also count the cells that contain anything but text. To do so, use the following modified version of the `COUNTIF` function. In this function, the argument specifies that only the non-text cells should be counted.

 If a cell has a mix of both text and numbers, it won't be counted.

=COUNTIF(D2:D6,"<>*")

![Enter the COUNTIF function to count all non-text cells.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-countif-count-non-text-cells.png) 

 This is the result you will see when you use the COUNTIF function to count the number of cells containing any text.

##  Count Cells With Specific Text in Excel

 To make Excel only count the cells that contain specific text, use an argument with the `COUNTIF` function.

 First, in your spreadsheet, select the cell in which you want to display the result.

 In the selected cell, type the following `COUNTIF` function and press Enter. In the function, replace `D2` and `D6` with the [range](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-playful-pioneers-the-kids-game-bazaar-for-2024/) where your cells are. Also, replace `a` with any character or word that your cell should have for it to be counted.

 The below function counts all cells that contain the letter `a`. This means, in our example, it will count both `Mahesh` and `David` as both these names have the letter `a` in them.

=COUNTIF(D2:D6,"*a*")

 Here's the result:

 To make the function count those cells that only have your specified character or word in them, remove the \* (asterisk) sign from before and after your character or word, as follows.

=COUNTIF(D2:D6,"a")

![Enter the COUNTIF function to count cells only containing specific text.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-countif-count-only-specific-text-cells.png)

 In our example, the count result is `0` because there are no cells that only contain the character `a` in them.

 And that's how you specify what cells to consider for calculation in your Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Very useful!
