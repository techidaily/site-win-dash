### Method 2: Update Razer Blade 17 Drivers from Windows Update

 Another way to get updated drivers for Razer Blade 17 is utilizing Windows Update. It’s a Windows built-in tool used to download and install device drivers to Windows. Windows Update takes you less time to find and install the correct driver versions.

 However, you’re not guaranteed to get the latest driver updates you need for your Razer laptop through this method because it remains difficult for manufacturers to get a driver into Windows Update.

 If you don’t mind, you can still follow the steps below (taking Windows 10 as an example). But we recommend that you choose **[Method 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to prevent underlying problems.

1. On the left-end of your screen, click the**Search icon** and type**Windows Update** . Then click**Check for updates** as it pops up as a matching result.

2. Click**Check for updates** and Windows will begin downloading and installing the available updates for your PC.

### Method 3: Update Razer Blade 17 Drivers Automatically (Recommended)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update Razer device drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. Download and install[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tu7.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tu8.jpg)
4. Restart your Razer laptop, and the updating will take effect.

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
