### Option 2: Update your Wi-Fi driver manually

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

**Important** :**If you can’t access the Internet** , you might first have to download the driver on a computer with workable network and then transfer the file to the target computer to install.**But if you do have Internet access** , do all the steps on the same(target) computer.

1. On the keyboard of the target computer, press  **the Windows logo key**  and   **R** at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and click  **OK**  .

3. On the computer with Internet, go to the brand manufacturer’s official website and check out the **Support** section for driver downloads.
4. Search the model of your wireless adapter, click the right download link for your Windows 7 OS. Usually a few download options will be listed but you might want to click **the first** result for the latest driver version.
5. Move the downloaded file to the computer without the Internet.
6. On the computer without the Internet, run the downloaded file (mostly either an exe. file or .inf file) and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the install.
7. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
