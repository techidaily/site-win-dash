### Option 2\. Download the driver from Canon official

 If the Windows Update doesn’t give you the latest version of the Canon MF743CDW driver, you can always find a new driver on the product information page.

 1) Go to the[product page of Canon MF743CDW](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/printers/color-laser/color-imageclass-mf743cdw) .

 2) In the top right corner, you can click the**PRODUCT INFORMATION** drop-down menu, and select**Drivers & Downloads** .

4) Once downloaded, run the driver file and complete the installation.

5) Restart your PC for the changes to take full effect.
