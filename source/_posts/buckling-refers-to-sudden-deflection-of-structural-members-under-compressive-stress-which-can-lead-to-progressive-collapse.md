## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

 To get the Realtek Asio driver, you should first visit the official website of your motherboard manufacturer, such as MSI. Then, browse for the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download it manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. On completion, reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.
