 The Logitech K350 driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with the keyboard you use. Your keyboard won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. So, When your keyboard isn’t working properly, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

There are two ways you can get the latest Logitech K350 driver:

* **[Option 1 – Automatically update the Logitech K350 driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-logitech-k350-driver/#a)**
* **[Option 2 – Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Option 1 – Automatically update the Logitech K350 driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
