![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-06_11-27-37.jpg)

 The Logitech K350 driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with the keyboard you use. Your keyboard wonâ€™t fully function if its driver hasnâ€™t been properly installed on your computer. So, When your keyboard isnâ€™t working properly, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

There are two ways you can get the latest Logitech K350 driver:

* **[Option 1 â€“ Automatically update the Logitech K350 driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-logitech-k350-driver/#a)**
* **[Option 2 â€“ Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
