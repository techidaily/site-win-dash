So if you want to update Epson printer drivers, such as Epson L3110 driver for Windows 10, you can go to their official website to download the drivers free of charge.

Following steps are for your reference how to download Epson printer drivers for Windows 10. 1\. Go to [Epson official website](http://www.epson.com/europe.html) .  2\.

 4\. Then you can follow the on-screen and step-by-step instructions to download the drivers for your Epson printer. To download right drivers, you are required to use your printer model name and the specific operating system (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit ). **Note:**For older printer products, Epson may not provide Windows 10 drivers. In this case, you can use a compatible driver for a previous operating system instead (e.g. Windows 7 in place of Windows 10). Drivers for Windows 7 and Windows 8 may be compatible with Windows 10\. Manually downloading drivers can be risky and time consuming, especially if you are novice in this area. Official drivers are needed as incorrect drivers may cause series of problems. You may not find the correct drivers after spending hours on it. Instead of manually downloading and updating drivers, you can use a driver update tool to help you.[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is one of driver update tools online.
