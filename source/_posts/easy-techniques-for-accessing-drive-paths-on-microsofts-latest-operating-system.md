 Copying a file or folderâ€™s path on Windows 11 is as easy as selecting an option in the right-click menu or pressing a keyboard shortcut. Weâ€™ll show you how to do it in various ways on your PC.

##  From the Right-Click Menu

 The easiest way to copy a file or folderâ€™s path is by choosing an option in that itemâ€™s right-click menu. You can use this method to copy paths for multiple items as well.

 To start, [open File Explorer](https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-get-and-use-pokemon-go-promo-codes-on-realme-c67-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) using Windows+E and locate your file or folder. [Right-click](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-recording-fun-6-techniques-to-document-minecraft-for-2024/) that item, and in the open menu, select "Copy as Path."

!['Copy as Path' highlighted in an item's right-click menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-copy-path-right-click-menu.jpg) 

 To copy paths of multiple files or folders, [select all those items](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-effective-strategies-to-capture-and-save-google-voice-dialogues-for-2024/), right-click a selected item, and choose "Copy as Path."

 Windows has copied the full absolute path to your selected item(s).

##  Using a Keyboard Shortcut

[Windows 11â€™s 22H2 update](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snickerscreen-composer/) introduced the ability to copy file and folder paths using a keyboard shortcut.

 To use it, launch File Explorer and locate your file or folder. Select the file or folder, then press Ctrl+Shift+C on your keyboard.

 To copy the path of multiple files and folders at once, highlight all of the folders and files and then press the Ctrl+Shift+C keyboard shortcut.

##  From a File Explorer Toolbar Option

 Windows 11â€™s File Explorer utility has a button on its toolbar to let you copy your file or folderâ€™s path. To use it, open File Explorer, and locate your file or folder and highlight the folder or file.

 From File Explorerâ€™s top toolbar, select the three dots and choose "Copy as Path."

 To copy multiple files or foldersâ€™ paths, highlight all those items before clicking "Copy Path."

##  How to Copy the Path of an App

 If you have an appâ€™s shortcut, and you want to copy that appâ€™s full path, right-click the shortcut and select "Properties." In the Shortcut tab, youâ€™ll see the full app path in the "Target" field. You can copy this field directly by selecting it and pressing Ctrl+C.

 If you launch your app via Windows Search and not from a desktop shortcut, itâ€™s still possible to find your appâ€™s full path. To do that, open the Start Menu and search for your app. Right-click the app and select "Open File Location."

 On the open window, right-click the app again and select "Open File Location."

 Your app is now highlighted. Right-click the app and select "Copy as Path."

##  Tips for Pasting the File, Folder, or App Path Youâ€™ve Copied

[Pasting the copied file, folder, or app path](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-gain-twitter-gifs-for-pc-download-made-simple/) is as easy as accessing a text field and pressing Ctrl+V. Alternatively, right-click the text field and choose "Paste."

 Note that your copied path is already enclosed with double quotes. If you plan to use the path in a command and the command requires using double quotes, you donâ€™t have to manually type the double quotes.

 Also, the path youâ€™ve copied doesnâ€™t contain any formatting. If you paste it in a document, such as a Microsoft Word document, itâ€™ll adapt to the documentâ€™s original formatting.

 And thatâ€™s how you find an itemâ€™s full path as well as paste it at the desired location on your Windows 11 machine. We hope you find the methods useful.
