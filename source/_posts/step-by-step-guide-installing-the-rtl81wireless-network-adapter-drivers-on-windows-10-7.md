 Are you seeking to download the corresponding drivers with your**wireless network adapter** ? If so, then youâ€™ve come to the right place. As we all know, drivers are essential to your devices but the process of downloading and installing drivers can be quite fiddly sometimes. Donâ€™t worry, here weâ€™ll show you how to update your network adapter drivers step by step.

## How to download and install your wireless network adapter drivers

 Generally there are two ways you can update your wireless network adapter drivers:

**[Option 1 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks â€“ easy even if youâ€™re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 â€“ Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1 â€“ Automatically update your wireless network adapter driver

 For some people, itâ€™s really time-consuming and error-prone to find the exact driver online, download it and install it step by step. If you want to save your time and effort, we highly recommend updating your drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a reliable driver updater tool.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

Or if you just want to update your wireless network adapter driver for now, simply click the**Update** button next to it.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-254.png)

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.

 We have a large number of wireless network adapter drivers that are both signed and tested by Microsoft, so thereâ€™s no need to worry whether or not you can find the correct driver with Driver Easy, or to worry about its security and compatibility.

### Option 2 â€“ Update your wireless network adapter driver manually

 If you feel like updating the wireless network adapter driver manually, hereâ€™s the simple and useful guide for you.

#### Update your driver via official websites

 Manufacturers of wireless network adapters such as Qualcomm keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to visit their official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually.

 Once youâ€™ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Update your driver via Device Manager

 One of the most commonly used methods to update your driver is downloading and installing it via Device Manager. However, you should note that sometimes Windows may **fail to detect the latest (and even necessary) driver for your device** . In this case, youâ€™ll have to search for the correct driver online or simply turn to **[Option 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
