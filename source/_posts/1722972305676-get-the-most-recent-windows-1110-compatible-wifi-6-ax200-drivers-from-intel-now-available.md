### Option 1: Install the latest AX200 driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using**Driver Easy** . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 If your computer has no Internet, you can use the **[offline scan feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy to download & install network drivers **even without Internet** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Launch Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
