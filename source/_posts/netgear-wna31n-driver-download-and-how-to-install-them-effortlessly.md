## Effortless Nahimic Audio Driver Enhancement: Download & Install Now

Are you trying to update drivers for your Nahimic audio software? If so, then this post is written for you – here you’ll be shown three ways to reach the goal. Read and check them out…

## Why should I update the Nahimic audio drivers?

**[Nahimic](https://www.nahimic.com/gamers/)**  is a piece of audio software that boosts audio and voice performance in games, thereby enhancing player immersion. Although the program itself is powerful enough, you can still expect it to do a better job by updating your sound card drivers.

 Besides, you should keep your audio drivers up-to-date in order to secure the stability of your audio devices. An outdated or corrupt driver can lead to the malfunctions of Nahimic, so if you want to get the most out of it, updating your audio driver seems necessary.

## How can I update the Nahimic audio drivers?

 There are mainly three ways you can update your audio drivers for Nahimic.

**[Option 1 – Download & install the drivers from manufacturers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  
  
**[Option 2 – Update the driver via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the most common method to update your driver, but sometimes Windows may fail to provide you with the latest (and even necessary) device drivers.

**[Option 3 – Update the driver automatically (recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download & install the drivers from manufacturers

 Usually you can get the sound card drivers from the manufacturer of your motherboard. To do this, simply visit its official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. If you’re using the Realtek HD Audio Driver, you can also download the driver from **[Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/en/downloads)**  .

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. On completion, restart your PC for the changes to be fully implemented.

### Option 3 – Update the driver automatically (recommended)

 Some people may find it hard to locate the correct driver online. And even if you successfully find it, it’s still time-consuming and error-prone to install the driver. So if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually,**you can do it automatically with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
