 HP Smart is what HP recommends to install when you’re trying to set up your printer. It’s a useful application that makes setting up a printer or troubleshooting printer issues become easier. But if you just need that driver for your LaserJet Pro M404n printer, you can download it in the**Basic Drivers** section.

## Update your printer driver

 When you’re not able to print a document or some of the features are not working as expected, you need to check if your printer driver is out of date or corrupt. While driver updates come with bug fixes and performance improvements. To get the most out of your printer, you’re supposed to update your printer driver.

 There are two ways you can update your printer driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your printer driver

 You can update your printer driver manually by visiting the the manufacturer’s website or go to the Device Manager:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type**devmgmt.msc** and press Enter.

 However, you may be told that your driver is already up to date. It’s possible that it still takes time for Microsoft to test and sign the new drivers that just have been submitted. If that’s your case, you can use the driver updater tools such as Driver Easy to automatically update your drivers.
