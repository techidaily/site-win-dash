 Are you looking to download and install the latest driver for**Intel 82579V Network Adapter** ? If the answer is “yes,” then you’ve come to the right place. Here we’ll show you how to update this driver step by step.

## Option 2 – Update the driver manually

 Intel keeps updating the Ethernet adapter drivers. To get the one you need, you should visit the download center of Intel, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the driver manually. Here’re the details (**network connectivity is required** ):

 1) Find your way to the download center of Intel, or you can click here:  
**[Downloads for Intel® 82579V Gigabit Ethernet PHY](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/52963/Intel-82579V-Gigabit-Ethernet-PHY)**

 2) After landing on the page, expand**Filter by** and select the version of your operating system.

3) Click the result that best suits your demand.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-85-1024x346.png)

This is an example of Windows 10.

 4) Under**Available Downloads** , you can see a number of drivers for different Windows versions. Find the one compatible with your Windows version and click**Download** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-86.png)

 5) Click**I accept the terms in the license agreement** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-662.png)

 6) After the file has been downloaded, double-click on it and follow the onscreen instructions to install the driver.

 7)**Reboot** your PC for the changes to be fully implemented even if you’re not asked to.
