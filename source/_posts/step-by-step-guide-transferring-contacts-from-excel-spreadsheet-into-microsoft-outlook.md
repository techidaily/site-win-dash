 Contact details stored in an Excel Worksheet can be easily exported and then imported into Outlook. Once the Excel file is saved to a CSV format, you can import it into your Outlook contacts list.

##  Save Your Contacts as a CSV File

 The contacts list below is stored in an Excel worksheet. Ensure your Excel spreadsheet is labeled in a similar fashion.

 To export the document as a CSV, first click "File" to open the menu. Next, select Save As > Browse.

 Select the "Browse" button to find the CSV file you want to import.

 Choose an option for how you would like Outlook to handle duplicate contact details and click the "Next" button.

 In this example, "Replace Duplicates with Items Imported" is selected. This will update the existing contacts in Outlook with the latest contact details.

![Browse for contacts list and replace duplicates](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/browse-and-duplicate-1.png) 

 Select the destination folder for the imported contacts and then click the "Next" button. The destination folder will probably be the Contacts folder, but it could be a different folder that can store contact details.

 Ensure that the action to import your contacts list into Outlook is selected.

 Click the "Map Custom Fields" button. This will enable us to correctly match up the column headers from the Excel spreadsheet to the corresponding fields in Outlook.

 In the Map Custom Fields Window, the fields from the CSV file appear in the "From" pane on the left. In the "To" pane on the right, the fields from the Contacts folder in Outlook are shown.

 Any fields that have already been successfully matched are listed under the "Mapped From" column on the right.
