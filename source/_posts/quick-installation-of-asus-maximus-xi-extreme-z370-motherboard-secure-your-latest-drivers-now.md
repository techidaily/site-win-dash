## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

**Intel** keeps updating the NVMe drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Intel Support](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/35125/Memory-and-Storage)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the driver manually.
