## Get Your Samsung ADB Drivers Instantly Here

If you’re developing an application for the Android platform, you may need to install Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and the driver for it. And if you’re using a Samsung Android cellphone, you should install the Samsung ADB driver.

## To install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer

There are two ways you can use to install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some patience to install the driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
