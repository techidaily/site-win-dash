**OR**

 **Option 1 – Download and update my Killer network driver manually**

 Killer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Killer’s official  website, check out the right driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually. (Which could either be an inf file or a zip file).

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 If you can’t access the Internet, you might have to download the driver package on a computer with workable network and then transfer the file to the target computer to install.
