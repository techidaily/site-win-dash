[**Method One: Update via Device Manager**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Two: Reinstall graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**Method Three: Update manually (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/radeon-hd-7850-graphics-driver-download-update-on-windows-10/#3)
  
 **Method One: Update via Device Manager**

 5) Then wait for Windows to get the latest version of the graphics driver it can find for you.  
  
 If you see the notification:  
  
 **Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date.**
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_58633c3acc5d9.png)

 It means that Windows cannot locate the latest version of the graphics card driver for you, so you might need to consider an alternative to get your graphics card driver updated.
  
 **Method Two: Reinstall graphics card driver**
  
**Note** : To reinstall the graphics card driver, you need to know for sure the model of your graphics card.
  
 1) Go to **AMD support** website. Scroll down a little bit to locate**Radeon HD 7000 series** section. Then choose the operating system that you are with accordingly. We choose **Windows 10 (64-bit)** .

 2) Click the**DOWNLOAD** button here to get the graphics card driver downloaded.

 6) Restart your computer.
  
 7) Double click the downloaded setup file of Radeon HD 7850, and then run the driver as instructed. You might need to restart your computer when the installation finishes.
  
 **Method Three: Update manually (Recommended)**
  
 If you don’t know exactly what’s the model of your graphics card, and neither can Windows help you find the latest version of the graphics card driver, you might need some help from[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , a product that automatically helps you detect, download and install device drivers that are missing or outdated on your computer.
