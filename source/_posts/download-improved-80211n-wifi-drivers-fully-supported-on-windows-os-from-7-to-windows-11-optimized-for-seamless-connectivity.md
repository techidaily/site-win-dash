 **Option 1 â€“ Download and update my Killer network driver manually**

 Killer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Killerâ€™s official  website, check out the right driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually. (Which could either be an inf file or a zip file).

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 If you canâ€™t access the Internet, you might have to download the driver package on a computer with workable network and then transfer the file to the target computer to install.
