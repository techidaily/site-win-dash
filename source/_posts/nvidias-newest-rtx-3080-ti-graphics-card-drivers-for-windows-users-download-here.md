### 2: Manual download from the manufacturer’s website

 Manufacturers release updates for their graphics cards quite often.

Search for your product, and make sure to only download the driver that’s**compatible with your Windows Version** . Once you’ve downloaded the driver, you’ll need to install it manually.
