**Netgear A6100** is a WiFi USB mini adapter that enables your computer to connect to your wireless network. Keeping its driver up to date will fix bugs and guarantee that your device works at peak performance.

**Option 1 – Manually –** You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended) –** This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
