### Option 2: Update Bluetooth driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update our Bluetooth driver since our Windows system automatically detects what Bluetooth driver we’re using and helps us find one available. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

 The message isn’t always true since Windows can be slow in keeping up with manufacturer’s driver releases. You might have to check out other methods to have the latest driver installed.
