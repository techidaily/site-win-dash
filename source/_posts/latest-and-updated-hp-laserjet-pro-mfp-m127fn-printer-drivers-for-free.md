## To update your NVIDIA Quadro graphics card driver

There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:

**Download and install your Quadro driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the **[NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/)**  , and searching for the latest driver for your device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your graphics card, and your version of Windows.

or

**Download and install your Quadro driver automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Quadro driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
