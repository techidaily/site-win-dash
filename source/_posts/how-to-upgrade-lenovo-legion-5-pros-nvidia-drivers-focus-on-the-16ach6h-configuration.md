 If you want to have a premium experience of playing a 3D game or watching a 3D movie on computer, you should update your Nvidia 3D Vision driver.

## **What is Nvidia 3D Vision?**

 Nvidia 3D Vision is a stereoscopic gaming kit. It uses LC shutter glasses and driver software to deliver stereoscopic 3D images for any Direct3D games and movies.

## How do I update my Nvidia 3D Vision driver?

There are two ways to update your Nvidia 3D Vision driver:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your Nvidia driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/nvidia-3d-vision-drivers-download-and-update-for-windows/#o2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
