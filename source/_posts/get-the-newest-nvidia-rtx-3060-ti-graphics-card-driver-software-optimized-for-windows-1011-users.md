### Option 1 – Download and install the latest graphics driver manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 AMD keeps updating new drivers for its graphics cards. If you’d like to update the graphics driver by yourself, carefully follow the steps below:

1. Go to **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .
2. Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64-bit) and download the driver manually.
3. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 Manually updating drivers is a bit time-consuming and error-prone. If you prefer a simpler method, check out the second option below.
