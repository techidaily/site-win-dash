## Why I need the Canon MG3620 driver?

 The printer driver runs on your operating system, and enables it to communicate with the printer you use. Your printer won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. Also, printer issues such as blank page printing, error code messages, etc. occur when your printer driver is corrupted or outdated. It’s essential that you have the latest correct driver for your printer at all times.
