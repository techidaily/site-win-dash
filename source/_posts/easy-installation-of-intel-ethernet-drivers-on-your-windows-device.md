## To update your Intel CPU drivers

Generally there are three ways you can update your Intel CPU drivers:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**[Option 3 – Update drivers via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This method is simple and commonly used. However, you should note that Windows may not be able to detect and download the latest (and even necessary) drivers for you.

### Option 1 – Automatically update your Intel CPU drivers

 For some people, it’s really time-consuming and error-prone to download and install drivers manually. If you want to save your time and effort, we highly recommend updating the drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a reliable driver updater tool.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
