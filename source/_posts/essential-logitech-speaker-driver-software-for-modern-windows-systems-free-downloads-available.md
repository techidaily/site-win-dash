### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Logitech keeps updating the T630 driver. To get the latest driver, you need to go to the **[Logitech official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

## Why I need the Logitech T630 driver?

 The Logitech T630 driver runs on your operating system and enables it to communicate with the mouse you use. Your mouse won’t fully function if its driver hasn’t been properly installed on your computer. Also, mouse issues may occur when your driver is corrupted or missing. So, we always recommend you keep your Logitech T630 driver updated for security and stability.
