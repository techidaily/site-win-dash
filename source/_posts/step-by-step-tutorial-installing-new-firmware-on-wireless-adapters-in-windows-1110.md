### **Option 2: Download and update your Ralink RT3290 driver manually (For Windows 8/7 Only)**

 Ralink Technology, Corp. was acquired by MediaTek in 2011, so you can no longer find the official website of Ralink. But luckily, the driver can still be found in **[mediatek.com](https://www.mediatek.com/) .**

 To find out the correct driver, you should first get to know some basic information about your operating system. If you do know it, simply skip to Step 3; If you don’t, then read on.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to fire up the**Run** box. Type**msinfo32** and click**OK** .

 2) In the**System Information** window, on the**System Summary** tab, you’ll see the overall information about your PC. Take note of these two items:**OS Name** and**System Type** . The combination of the two shows exactly what version of Windows you have.

 For example, this is a screenshot of Windows 8.1 Pro (64-bit). And there’s one thing you should know: regarding**System Type** , “x64-based PC” stands for the 64-bit version; in contrast, “x86-based PC” stands for 32-bit.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) After knowing the version of your Windows operating system, you should now search for the driver online. You can either find your own way to the official website of MediaTek, or you can simply click[https://www.mediatek.com/](https://www.mediatek.com/) .

 4) There’s a search bar at the top of the website. Type**RT3290** , and then hit**Enter** on your keyboard.

 5) Find**RT3290** and click**Read More** .

 6) Click on the small blue icon below**Download Drivers** .

 7) Wait for the download process to complete, then navigate to the file you’ve just downloaded.

 8) Open that file and double-click**Disk 1 > drivers** . If you’re using Windows 7, then go on to double-click**Win7** ; if you’re using Windows 8, then double-click**Win8** instead.

 Unfortunately MediaTek doesn’t provide the corresponding driver for Windows 10, so if you’re using Windows 10, please turn to **[Option 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 9) Make sure you open the right files based on your Windows version. In the end, you’ll see a file as illustrated below.

 When you double-click**devcon64.exe** , you’ll be prompted to decompress the folders. Select**Extract all** .

 10) Click**Browse…** to select a destination and check the**Show extracted files when complete** box. On completion, click**Extract** .

 11) When the extracted file pops up,**copy** its file address.

 12) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the**Run** box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

 13) In the**Device Manager** window, double-click**Network adapters** to expand the drop-down list. Then right-click**Ralink RT3290 Wi-Fi Adapter** and select**Update driver** .

 14) Click**Browse my computer for driver software** .

 15)**Paste** the file address copied in**Step 11** onto the address bar, and then tick the**Include subfolders** option. After that, click**Next** .

 16) Now Windows will search for the driver and install it automatically. When everything’s done, click**Finish** . Then**restart** your computer for the changes to take effect.

 After all these steps, your driver for the Ralink RT3290 Wi-Fi Adapter should have been updated to the latest version. Please check the status of your Ralink RT3290 Wi-Fi Adapter in Device Manager. If there’s still a yellow warning icon next to that device, meaning your driver hasn’t been installed properly, you can try[**Option 1**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to see if that can get you out of trouble.
