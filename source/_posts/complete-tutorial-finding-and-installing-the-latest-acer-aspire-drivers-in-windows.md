3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
