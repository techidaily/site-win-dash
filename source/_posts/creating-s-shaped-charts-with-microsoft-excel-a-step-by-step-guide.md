## Creating S-Shaped Charts with Microsoft Excel: A Step-by-Step Guide

When you create a line graph in Excel, the lines are angled and have hard edges by default. You can easily change this to a curved graph with nice, smooth lines for a more polished look. We'll walk you through the process step by step to convert your [graph](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/gaming-revolution-top-5-android-solutions-for-playstation-2-titles-for-2024/).

 In this example, we want to create a curved line graph from this data on cookie sales.

![Sample data for a line graph](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookie-data.png) 

 Select and highlight the range A1:F2 and then click Insert > Line or Area Chart > Line.

 The line graph is inserted with straight lines corresponding to each data point.

 To edit this to a curved line, right-click the data series and then select the "Format Data Series" button from the pop-up menu.

 Click the "Fill & Line" category and then check the box for "Smoothed Line."

 Using a smoothed line can help make your line graphs look smarter and more professional.

 Smoothed lines can also be a clever way of distinguishing one data series from another. For example, targets from actuals or last year to this year.
