### Option 2: Update Bluetooth driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update our Bluetooth driver since our Windows system automatically detects what Bluetooth driver we’re using and helps us find one available. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

2. Locate and double-click on**Bluetooth** . And you can see the manufacturer from the name of your**Bluetooth** (in my case, Bluetooth).
