If you want to keep your Epson WF-2750 printer in good condition, or if you want to fix its driver issues, you should update your printer driver.

## To update your Epson WF-2750 printer driver

The following are two methods to update your printer driver.

1. [**Download your printer driver from the Epson website**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your printer driver automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Download your printer driver from the Epson website

You can download your Epson WF-2750 printer driver from Epson and install it on your own. To do so:**1)**Go to the **[Epson official website](https://epson.com/usa)**  and search “_wf 2750_“.

**2)** Go to your printer support page, then download the correct and latest driver to your computer.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

**3)**Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.
