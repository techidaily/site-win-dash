Microsoft can detect the latest driver for your devices. You can let Microsoft help you detect the latest HL-2240 driver for you in Device Manager. Here’s how: 1) On your keyboard, hold down the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1de55ae1611.png)** and then press**R**to bring up a**Run**box. 2) Type**devmgmt.msc**and press**Enter**.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1e3de8cc341.jpg)

Windows would then start to detect and download the latest driver if it detects one. 4) Restart your computer and reconnect your HL-2240 printer with your Windows computer. Then try to print a file to see if it works. For some reasons, Microsoft cannot always find the latest driver. If you see the message saying**The best drivers for your device are already installed**, you might have to choose other ways to update your driver.
