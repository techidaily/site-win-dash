 Having an issue with your**Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 driver** on your computer? Don’t worry. You can fix the driver issue by installing the latest driver, and this post will show how to do that.

 If you want to keep your Intel adapter in good condition, and get the best possible network performance, you should consider updating the Intel Centrino Advanced N 6205 driver.

## How to install Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 driver

There are two ways you can update your Intel Centrino 6205 driver:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/intel-centrino-advanced-n-6205-driver-issues-in-windows-solved/#M2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple or mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Intel keeps releasing latest drivers. To get the Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 driver, you need to go to the **[Intel download center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  , find the driver for Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 adapter. Be sure to find the latest version that is compatible with the OS running in your computer (for example, Windows 10 64 bit).
