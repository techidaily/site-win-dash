### Option 1 – Update the drivers manually

 Intel keeps updating the NUC drivers. To get them, you need to visit the support website of Intel, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the **[Drivers & Software page](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) [](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-MAXIMUS-X-HERO/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  of Intel.
2. Under**Select your product** , click**Intel NUC** .

3. On the next page, expand**View by product** and select your model. Go on to expand**Filter by** and select your operating system.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-21_17-49-40.jpg)
4. Then you’ll be presented with a list of available downloads. Take note of their type because only those classified as**Driver** should be your targets, unless you’re also looking for BIOS updates and the like.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-21_18-10-18.jpg)
5. Click on your desired driver. Then, click**Download** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-21_18-17-34.jpg)
6. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
7. **Reboot** your computer for the changes to take effect. (You can do this after all the drivers have been installed.)

 Repeat Step 5 through Step 7 until you finish downloading and installing all the drivers you need. This may seem a bit time-consuming and error-prone, though. If you’re interested in the benefits of updating drivers automatically with a driver updater tool, read on and find out how.
