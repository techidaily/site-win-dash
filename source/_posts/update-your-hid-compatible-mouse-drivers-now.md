### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

Brother keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Brother website](https://support.brother.com)** , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
