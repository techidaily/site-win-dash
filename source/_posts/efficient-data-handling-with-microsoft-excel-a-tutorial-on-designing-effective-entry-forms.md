 Manual data entry can be time-consuming and error prone. But if you take a few minutes to create a data entry form in Microsoft Excel, you can improve the process and reduce the risk of mistakes like [missing data](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-12-pro-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/).

##  Add the Form Option

 To use the Form option in Excel, you'll need to add it to either the Quick Access toolbar or ribbon. The simplest of the two is the [Quick Access toolbar](https://location-social.techidaily.com/set-your-preferred-job-location-on-linkedin-app-of-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/). If you decide to add it to your ribbon instead, you'll need to [create a special tab](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-measure-the-performance-of-igtv-videos-for-2024/) for it, which may not be ideal.

 To add the Form button to your Quick Access toolbar, click the arrow in the toolbar to open the Customize Quick Access Toolbar menu. Select "More Commands."

![Pick More Commands](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/QuickAccessMoreCommands-ExcelDataEntryForm.png) 

 Confirm that Quick Access Toolbar is selected on the left. In the "Choose Commands From" drop-down box on the left, choose "All Commands."

 In the "Customize Quick Access Toolbar" drop-down box on the right, choose whether you'd like to add the Form button to all documents or your current one.

![Choose All Commands a pick the document](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ChooseCommandsDocument-ExcelDataEntryForm.png) 

 Scroll through the All Commands list and pick "Form." Click the "Add" button to add it to the toolbar.

![Select Form and click Add](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FormAdd-ExcelDataEntryForm.png) 

 Click "OK" to close the settings and return to your spreadsheet. You should see the Form button in the Quick Access Toolbar.

##  Convert Your Data to a Table

 To use the form, you'll need labels for each field. These come in the form of table headers. If the data is already [formatted as a table](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-convert-your-best-videography-into-melodic-mp3s-insta/), you're one step ahead and can move on to using the form. If not, you can easily convert it.

 Select the cells containing the data. Go to the Home tab and the Styles section of the ribbon. Click "Format as Table" and choose a table style.

![Select a table style](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FormatAsTable-ExcelDataEntryForm.png) 

 In the Create Table pop-up window, confirm the cell range and check the "My Table Has Headers" box. Click "OK."
