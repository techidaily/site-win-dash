![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-164.png)

 Are you looking for the**Intel NVMe drivers** ? If the answer is “yes,” then you’ve come to the right place. As we all know, drivers are essential to your devices but the process of downloading and installing drivers can be quite fiddly sometimes. Don’t worry, here we’ll show you how to update your Intel NVMe drivers.

## How to update your Intel NVMe driver

There are two ways you can update your driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  

 OR  

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-intel-nvme-drivers-quickly-easily/#option2) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

**Intel** keeps updating the NVMe drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Intel Support](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/35125/Memory-and-Storage)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file (usually with the EXE extension) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

## Option 2 – Automatically update the Intel NVMe driver
