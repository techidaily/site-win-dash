There are two ways you can update your HP Designjet 500 drivers:

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 HP printers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the [HP driver download page](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-envy-5000-all-in-one-printer-series/14095644/model/14095768) , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.
**Note** : HP DesignJet 500 printer belongs to HP DesignJet series printer, so the driver for the HP DesignJet series Printer is also suitable for HP DesignJet 500 printer.
