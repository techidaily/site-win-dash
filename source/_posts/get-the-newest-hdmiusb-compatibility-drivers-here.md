## STEP 1 – Confirm it’s a driver problem

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click **OK** . This will start the Device Manager.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dvd1.jpg)
3. In Device Manager, click**View** and then select**Show hidden devices** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dvd.jpg)
4. Expand**DVD/CD-ROM drives** , if you see a yellow mark next to the device name (usually an exclamation or a question mark), there’s a problem with the driver, and you need to update it.
