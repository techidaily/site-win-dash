 If you have a Samsung 850 EVO SSD, you should read this post to help your device get a better performance.

 Many of you just plug SSD into your PC, use it and then roll out, but thereâ€™s a driver you should install and help it boost stably.

## Why you need Samsung 850 EVO driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers havenâ€™t updated, devices canâ€™t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 Thatâ€™s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.
