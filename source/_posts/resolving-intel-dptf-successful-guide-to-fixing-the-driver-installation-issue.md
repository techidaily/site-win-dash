 It’s always important to **update your graphics driver to its latest version**   so as to get the most out of the graphics card (like improving screen resolution, reducing lag, preventing system crashes etc.).

 In this post, we’re going to show you 2 easy ways to get the latest driver for your **AMD Vega** series  graphics card.

## Choose the way you prefer

 Both options below work in**Windows 10** ,**8.1** and**7** .

[**Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/amd-vega-drivers-download-update-for-gamers-easily/#O1) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Manually –**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.
