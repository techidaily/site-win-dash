 With Microsoft Excel's

        `UPPER`
    
 , `LOWER` , and `PROPER` functions, you can capitalize your text as well as turn your text to lowercase or proper case. You can specify your text as a [cell reference](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-step-by-step-guide-to-kinemasters-green-screen-mastery-for-2024/) or directly in the function. We'll show you how.

##  Capitalize Text Using the UPPER Function

 If you'd like to turn all letters of [the text you've added](https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-review-top-long-reach-routers-dominating-the-market-in-ebytes/) to uppercase (i.e., capitalize your text), specify your text in Excel's

        `UPPER`
    
 function as follows.

 First, in your spreadsheet, select the cell in which you want to display the uppercase text.

![Select a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1-excel-uppercase-select-cell.png) 

 In the selected cell, type the following function and press Enter. In the function, make sure to replace `B3` with the cell that contains the text you want to capitalize.

=UPPER(B3)

![Enter the UPPER function.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2-excel-uppercase-function.png) 

 If you don't have your text in a cell, specify the text directly in the function as follows. In this function, replace `My Text` with the text you want to turn to uppercase.

=UPPER("My Text")

 Excel will display the resulting uppercase text in your selected cell.
