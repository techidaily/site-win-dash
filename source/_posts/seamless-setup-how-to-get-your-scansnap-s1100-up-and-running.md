## Why should I update the Samsung M2070 driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is a printer, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, when you encounter a problem with your Samsung M2070 printer (such as[printer not connected](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), try updating the corresponding driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble. Or if you just want your printer to work in tip-top condition, it’s also wise of you to update the driver.

On the pop-up page, click**Choose a different OS** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-06_18-41-26.jpg) Then select the version of your operating system (such as Windows 10, 64-bit) and click**Change** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-06_18-46-05.jpg)
3. In the lower part, expand **All drivers > Driver-Product Installation Software > Basic Drivers** . Then from the results, select**Samsung SL-M2070 Series Print Driver** and click**Download** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-06_18-52-11.jpg)
