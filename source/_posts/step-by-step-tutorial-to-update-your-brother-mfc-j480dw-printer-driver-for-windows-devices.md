 According to Brother’s official website, we’ll first have to uninstall the older driver first. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key  ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and **R**  at the same time. Then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click   **OK**  .
