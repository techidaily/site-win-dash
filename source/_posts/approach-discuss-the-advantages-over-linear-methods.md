 This surround sound RGB gaming headset Arctis 5 provides an immersive gaming experience, but sometimes it can bump into issues. And when they do, you can follow[**this troubleshooting guide**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to fix your mic issues, or you can update the Arctis 5 drivers directly.

## How to update Actis 5 drivers

 Actually, you don’t have to install the specific driver to make SteelSeries Arctis 5 work or be recognized successfully. It comes with a plug-and-play feature.

 All you need to have is the generic USB audio driver and the onboard sound driver. Here’s how to do it:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/steelseries-arctis-5-drivers/#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1: Manually update the sound driver

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.  
![uninstall graphics driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/device-manager.jpg)
2. Expand the**Sound, video and game controllers** . Then right-click the related devices, and select**Update driver** .
3. Click**Search automatically for drivers** .
4. Windows will start searching for the latest drivers and install them for you.

**Note:** Windows Device Manager doesn’t always detect outdated drivers. Nor does it always give you the latest available version if you update a driver. ([**Learn why…**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) )

 If Windows Device Manager fails to find a new driver for you, you need to source the driver directly from the device manufacturer or use a tool like ours, called **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , to do it automatically.

### Option 2: Automatically update all your device drivers

 One of the most common causes of sound issues is an outdated or faulty sound driver. Your SteelSeries Artis 5 is no exception.

 If you find the manual updating process tedious and time-consuming, you can do it update all your drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It always gives you the latest available driver.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to your sound device or your Arctis 5 to download the latest and correct driver for it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/audio-drivers.jpg)  
 Or you can also click the**Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will have full tech support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.)
