 There’re two ways you can update the Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3160 driver:

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

---

## Option 1 – Automatically update the driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually,**you can do it automatically with** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update drivers both online and offline. According to your actual situation, jump ahead to the section you’re interested in:

* **[My network connection is not stable but still works at times](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[My network connection doesn’t work at all](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
