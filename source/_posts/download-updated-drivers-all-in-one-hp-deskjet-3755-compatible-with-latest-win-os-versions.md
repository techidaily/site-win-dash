 Nothing is more frustrating than a non-working printer when you hurry to print a document. This is a common problem for many users and is likely related to the printer driver issues.

 Simply put, a driver is a software component that enables your device to communicate with the operating system. So, if the driver for HP DeskJet 2652 is outdated, incorrect, or corrupt, your printer may stop working and run into errors. In this post, we’ll introduce three ways to update HP DeskJet 2652 driver on Windows PC quickly and easily.

1. **[Update your driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Automatically update your HP DeskJet 2652 driver (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-hp-deskjet-2652-driver/#option2)**
3. **[Update your HP DeskJet 2652 driver using Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**1)** Go to **[HP support website](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers)**  . Select**Printer** to continue.

**4)** Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, there is an easier and quicker option.

## Option 2 – Automatically update your HP DeskJet 2652 driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your printer driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
