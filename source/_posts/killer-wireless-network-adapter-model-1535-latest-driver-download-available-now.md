### Option 1 – Automatically update your wireless network adapter driver

 For some people, it’s really time-consuming and error-prone to find the exact driver online, download it and install it step by step. If you want to save your time and effort, we highly recommend updating your drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a reliable driver updater tool.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-06-10_14-52-48-1.png)

Or if you just want to update your wireless network adapter driver for now, simply click the**Update** button next to it.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-254.png)

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Option 2 – Update your wireless network adapter driver manually

 If you feel like updating the wireless network adapter driver manually, here’s the simple and useful guide for you.

#### Update your driver via official websites

 Manufacturers of wireless network adapters such as Qualcomm keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to visit their official websites, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Update your driver via Device Manager

 One of the most commonly used methods to update your driver is downloading and installing it via Device Manager. However, you should note that sometimes Windows may **fail to detect the latest (and even necessary) driver for your device** . In this case, you’ll have to search for the correct driver online or simply turn to **[Option 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. Press the**Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type **devmgmt.msc**  and click **OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-255.png)
