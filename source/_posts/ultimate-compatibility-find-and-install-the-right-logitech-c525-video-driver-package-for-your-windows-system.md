### **Option 1 â€“**  **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download the audio driver manually from your PC manufacturerâ€™s website or the sound cardâ€™s website. I recommend you to check for the new driver on your PC manufacturerâ€™s website first, as the PC manufacturers would customize the audio driver in order to provide the best performance of the device installed on their machine. If your PC manufacturer doesnâ€™t provide the new audio driver you need, you can go to the sound cardâ€™s website to download the audio driver.

**IMPORTANT** : Before you get started, ensure that you know the model name of your PC or the model name of the sound card, and the specific operating system that your PC is running (Windows 7 64-bit or Windows 7 32-bit).
