## To update your Intel CPU drivers

Generally there are three ways you can update your Intel CPU drivers:

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
