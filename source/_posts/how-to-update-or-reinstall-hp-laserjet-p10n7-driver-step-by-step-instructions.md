## Pick the way you prefer

 There are two ways you can update the drivers for your**HP** PC in **Windows 10** , **8** or **7** :

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 **Option 1 – Download and install the drivers for your HP PC manually**

**WARNING** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [**Option 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Rest assured that the link below is the official website and 100% safe. So to manually update our HP drivers:

 First head to **[HP’s official website](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/home.html)** [](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us) and check out the section for driver downloads. Then enter the serial number of your **HP** PC and search for the specific drivers you’re to update.

 Be sure to choose **ONLY** drivers corresponding with your flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually (which could either be an **.inf** file or a **.zip** file).

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
