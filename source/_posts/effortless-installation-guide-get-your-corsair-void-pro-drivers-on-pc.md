**Razer mamba gaming mouse** is a very popular choice for game players. To make your Razer mamba mouse work properly, you’re recommended to keep its driver software up-to-date.

## Why you need the Razer mamba driver?

If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.
