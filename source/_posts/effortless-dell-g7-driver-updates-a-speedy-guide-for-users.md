![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-387.png)

 To get the most out of your computer, you should always keep the device drivers up to date. If you’re looking for Intel CPU drivers or other motherboard device drivers, you’ve definitely come to the right place. Here in this post you’ll learn how to update these drivers step by step.

## To update your Intel CPU drivers

Generally there are three ways you can update your Intel CPU drivers:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**[Option 3 – Update drivers via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This method is simple and commonly used. However, you should note that Windows may not be able to detect and download the latest (and even necessary) drivers for you.

### Option 1 – Automatically update your Intel CPU drivers

 2) In the**Device Manager** window, double-click on the**Processors** node to expand its drop-down list. Then right-click on the device whose driver you want to update and select**Update driver** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-394.png)

 3) Click**Search automatically for updated driver software** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-395.png)

4) Wait for the download and installation to be completed.
