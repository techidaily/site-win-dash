![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-289.png)

 Looking to update your**AMD Ryzen 5 2500U drivers** ? If yes, then you’ve come to the right place. In this post, you’ll have two ways to download and install the driver correctly and efficiently.

## Why should I keep my drivers up-to-date

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is a processor, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, if you bump into problems relating to a specific device (e.g. the device stops working), try updating its driver and wait to see whether your problems are resolved. Also, it’s wise of you to keep the drivers up-to-date if you want to make the most out of your devices.

## How to update your AMD Ryzen 5 2500U drivers

There are mainly two options for you:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-amd-ryzen-5-2500u-drivers-quickly-easily/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
