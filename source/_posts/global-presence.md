## Latest Dell SMBus Controller Firmware Enhancement - Download Now

**SM Bus Controller** is a chipset on the motherboard that monitors the voltage and temperature of the board. If you see a warning icon in front of SM Bus Controller in**Device Manager** on your**Dell** computer, it indicates that the hardware is not recognized by Windows or its driver is not properly installed. But don’t worry – this is often a driver issue that can be easily fixed by updating its chipset driver…

 As is explained previously, you should update the corresponding chipset driver if you want to make sure SM Bus Controller works properly on your PC and that it won’t show up with a warning icon on it.

There are two ways you can update your chipset driver:
