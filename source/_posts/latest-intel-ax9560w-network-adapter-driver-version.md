## Two ways to update your Intel network adapter driver

### Option 1: Automatic update (Recommended!)

 If you don’t like the idea of keeping an eye on the latest updates and manually installing the new network driver every time, you can try [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct Intel network driver for you and your Windows version, then it’ll download and install the driver correctly:

 The steps below only work when your PC still has access to the Internet. If you can’t connect to the Internet on your PC, you can try the[Offline Scan feature of Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Another PC with Internet access is required,

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged network driver to automatically download the correct version of the drivers, then you can manually install them (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. For example, you can update both your graphics driver and network adapter driver with just one click. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
