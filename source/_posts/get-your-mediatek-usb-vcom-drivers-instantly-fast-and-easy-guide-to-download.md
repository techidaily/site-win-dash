 Are you looking to download and install the latest driver for**Intel 82579V Network Adapter** ? If the answer is “yes,” then you’ve come to the right place. Here we’ll show you how to update this driver step by step.

There’re mainly two options for you:

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
