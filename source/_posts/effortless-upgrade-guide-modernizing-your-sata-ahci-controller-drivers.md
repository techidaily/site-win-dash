If you want to update the sound driver to fix computer no sound issues, you can use one of the methods below to update the sound driver. We’ve put together two methods here to update the sound drivers; just pick the easier one for you. All steps below apply to Windows 10, 8.1 & 7.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** in the run box and click the**OK** button to open Device Manager.
