### Key Takeaways

 Download one of these event planning templates from Microsoft Office's official template download site. Templaets are available for a wide variety of events, including parties and baby showers, budgeting and fundraisers, and guest lists.

 Microsoft Excel is often synonymous with company financials, [household budgets](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-a-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/), and other numeric data. But Excel can be a terrific tool for planning events like weddings, showers, parties, and more, too. Keep reading for templates you can use to plan your next event.

 From the budget and the guest list to the music, you can spend more time getting ready and less time tracking everything. If you're an Excel user who opens the application each day, consider using it for your next event.
